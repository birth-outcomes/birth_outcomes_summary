# Birth outcomes summary

## The problem

The main problem is that some clinicians intervene too late, or not at all, in childbirth and the infant ends up with avoidable harm, such as Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HEI), risking long-term disability. A related problem is that other clinicians intervene unnecessarily too often, subjecting the mother to unnecessary interventions, such as Caesarian Section (CS).

## The target

The ultimate target is to build a machine learning (ML) algorithm that monitors live data during childbirth, taking into account pre-existing risk factors, that alerts clinicians when infant health is at increased risk if intervention is delayed or missed.
