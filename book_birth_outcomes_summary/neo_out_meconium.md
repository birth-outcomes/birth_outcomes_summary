# Meconium-stained amniotic fluid

**Meconium** is the first feces of the newborn and is typically sticky and greenish-yellowish-black. If this happens in utero (whilst the baby is still in the womb), the meconium can get into the amniotic fluid (the liquid surrounding the fetus).

**Meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF)** 'occurs in 5 to 20% deliveries at term' and is considered a risk factor for several different neonatal complications including:
* **Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy**
* **Neonatal sepsis**
* **Neonatal seizures**
* **Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)** - respiratory distress in infants with MSAF that can't otherwise be explained - only developed by 5% infants exposed to MSAF
* **Cerebral palsy**
