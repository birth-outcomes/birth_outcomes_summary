## Introduction to neonatal encephalopathy

'**Perinatal brain injury** is common in **term infants**' (births between 37 and 42 completed weeks) in all countries. 'Almost all forms of perinatal brain injury will result into **neonatal encephalopathy**' (brain disease, damage or malfunction). 'Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1-3 per 1000 infants born at term.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.nbd.2015.09.011)

### Causes

The most common cause of encephalopathy is **hypoxia ischaemia**, sometimes referred to as **asphyxia, perinatal asphyxia, or birth asphyxia**.
* *Hypoxia is when there are low levels of oxygen in the blood flowing to the tissues.*
* *Ischaemia is when blood flow (and therefore oxygen) is restricted/reduced to tissues.*
* *Perinatal is pregnancy and first 12 months after childbirth*

'However, it is not always possible to document a clear hypoxicischaemic episode during labour, and several other important aetiologies should be considered as being a primary or contributory cause of the encephalopathy. Other causes of neonatal encephalopathy include include:'
* **Perinatal/neonatal stroke** (ischemic perinatal stroke (IPS) is the leading known cause of hemiplegic CP [[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpeds.2022.100025))
* **Infection** (chorioamnionitis)
* **Intracranial haemorrhage** (bleed in the skull/brain)
* **Congenital brain anomalies/malformations** (brain 'abnormalities present at birth that can result from developmental disruptions at various embryonic or fetal stages'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spen.2022.100973))
* **Neurometabolic** (extensive and diverse set of neurometabolic disorders that can impact the neonatal prain, presentation is non-specific and can mimic acquired things like HIE and sepsis. They are rare, and are primarily genetic disorders leading to disruption of enzyme activity, cellular transport, or energy production [[source]](https://journals.lww.com/topicsinmri/fulltext/2018/08000/neurometabolic_disorders_of_the_newborn.1.aspx))
* **Genetic syndromes**

### Focus on HIE and chorioamnionitis

The following two pages introdue HIE and chroioaminoitis in detail. The reason for the focus on these was that they were raised in the meeting on 24th January 2024.

The reason I go on to focus on markers of HIE is because that was the primary focus in the meeting, and as that is the most common cause of encephalopathy, and appears most frequently in the literature around this.
