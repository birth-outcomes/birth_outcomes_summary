# Neonatal resuscitation

Types of resuscitation effort required:
* Around 5 to 10% of all babies will require some degree of resuscitation / assistance to begin breathing at birth. Examples include tactile stimulation, airway clearing or positiong.
* About 3 to 6% require basic neonatal resucitation, which would incorporate assisted ventilation.
* Advanced resuscitation is required for less than 1% of all babies born, and for around 2% of babies who do not breathe at bith. This involves chest compression, intubation or medications.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.ijgo.2009.07.013)

Some terms related to asphyxia, death and resuscitation have been used interchangeably previous. Currently the terminology is:
* Perinatal asphyxia - insufficient oxygen (before, during or after birth). Intrapartum asphyxia accounts for both fetal deaths in labour and neonatal deaths.
* Intrapartum fetal death - death of fetus during labour (formerly called birth asphyxia). Hypoxia is thought to be a factor in 90% of intrapartum deaths.
* Neonatal encephalopathy - brain damage in neonates

## Suitability as a model outcome

Potential cons:
* Would the data have information on the type of resuscitation
* Hypoxia can lead to you needing resuscitation, and can also lead to HIE, so they are linked - but not all babies with HIE will have needed resucitation? If hypoxia was before birth, or if they are managing to breath?
