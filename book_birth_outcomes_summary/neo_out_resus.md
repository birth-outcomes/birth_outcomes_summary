# Neonatal resuscitation

## Terminology

Some terms related to asphyxia, death and resuscitation have been used interchangeably previous. Currently the terminology is:
* **Perinatal asphyxia** - insufficient oxygen (before, during or after birth)
* **Neonatal encephalopathy** - brain damage in neonates
* **Intrapartum fetal death** - death of fetus during labour (formerly called birth asphyxia)

## Resuscitation

'Care in the first ten minutes of life is focussed around aeration of the lung and any problem in effectively opening and maintaining the airway is immediately problematic. Similarly, the mode of arrest in the older neonate is usually respiratory and so managing the airway is key'.[[BAPM Framework]](https://kids.bwc.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DA_framework_final_October_2020.docx-2.pdf)

In terms of the proportions of neonates requiring assistance:
* Around **5 to 10%** of all babies will require **some degree of resuscitation/assistance** to begin breathing at birth. Examples include tactile stimulation, airway clearing or positiong.
* About **3 to 6%** require **basic resucitation**, which would incorporate assisted ventilation.
* **Less than 1%** of all babies born will require **advanced resuscitation** - and this is around 2% of babies who do not breathe at birth. Advanced resuscitation can involve chest compression, intubation or medications.[[Wall et al. 2009]](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.ijgo.2009.07.013) Around 1-2 per 1000 liveborn babies will require some assistance in breathing to transition successfully, and of these between 2-10% may not respond to mask ventilation leading to an attempt at intubation. Fortunately intrauterine preparation for birth (at full term) offers significant physiological adaptation to sustained hypoxia, offering potential for some resilience in the circumstance of a difficult airway problem. Unwell babies at delivery may however have less physiological reserve, particularly if they lack innate respiratory effort.'[[BAPM Framework]](https://kids.bwc.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DA_framework_final_October_2020.docx-2.pdf)

'Most infants adapt well to extra-uterine life but some require help with stabilisation, or resuscitation. Up to 85% breathe spontaneously without intervention; a further 10% respond after drying, stimulation and airway opening manoeuvres; approximately 5% receive positive pressure ventilation. Intubation rates vary between 0.4 and 2%. **Fewer than 0.3% of infants receive chest compressions and only 0.05% receive adrenaline**.'[[source]](https://www.resus.org.uk/library/2021-resuscitation-guidelines/newborn-resuscitation-and-support-transition-infants-birth)

## Suitability as a model outcome

Uncertainties:
* Would we have data on the type/extent/nature of resuscitation?
* Hypoxia can lead to you needing resuscitation, and can also lead to HIE, so they are linked - but not all babies with HIE will have needed resucitation? If hypoxia was before birth, or if they are managing to breath?

`````{admonition} Potentially suitable
:class: warning

Uncertain - depends on availability of data, and feelings on specificity of outcome for HIE.
