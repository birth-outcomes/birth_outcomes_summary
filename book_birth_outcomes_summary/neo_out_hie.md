# More on HIE

## Definition of HIE

The definition of HIE was discussed extensively on a prior page, but a few key points are summarised below.

**Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)** is a type of brain injury that occurs because a hypoxic-ischaemic event prevents adequate blood flow to the infant's brain during prenatal, intrapartum or the postnatal period. 'It occurs in 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births in developed countries'. 'The incidence of HIE has not declined even with advances in obstetric care (i.e. fetal monitoring) aimed at preventing the hypoxic-ischemic event.'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004) Rapid recognition of and response to hypoxic ischaemia is extremely challenging for obstetricians.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1576/toag.13.3.169.27669)

By the age of 2, 40 to 60% of infants with HIE will either **die or have severe disabilities**.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004) These include:
* **Intellectual disability**
* **Epilepsy**
* **Cerebral palsy (CP)**

## Causes of HIE

The exact cause of HIE is often not identified. Causes include:
* Cord prolapse
* Uterine rupture
* Abruptio placenta
* Placenta previa
* Maternal hypotension
* Breech presentation
* Should dystonia[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004)

There have been several medical malpractice claims related to HIE. This list of causes from [Michigan Cerbral Palsy Attornerys](https://www.michigancerebralpalsyattorneys.com/causes-and-risk-factors-of-cerebral-palsy/labor-and-delivery-problems/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie-infographic/) includes some examples that relate to that.
* **Birth trauma** - delayed emergency C-section, prolonged and arrested labour, post-term pregnancy, anaesthesia mistakes, intracrainal haemmhorage, fetal monitoring errors
* **Abnormal size and presentation** - cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), breech presentation, face presentation, macrosomia
* **Labour and delivery problems** - miuse of pitocin or cytotec, uterine rupture, placental abruption, umbilical cord problems (prolapse, compression, nuchal and short), placenta previa, uteroplacental insufficiency, premature rupture of membranes
* **Maternal health problems** - pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios
* **Infant health problems** - fetal stroke, mismanagement of fetal respiration after delivery, mismanaged of fetal anemia after delivery

Note: Haven't checked all these - but for example of fetal stroke, from a quick google, it appears that HIE and neonatal stroke can often occur together, and that it seems more that the asphyxia is then a risk factor for stroke.

## Neontal tests for HIE

A variety of methods can be used to diagnose HIE, including the APGAR score, brain imaging, umbilical cord blood gas tests, and developmental evaluations.[[source]](https://hiehelpcenter.org/medical/identifying-hie/tests-evaluations-screening/)

In terms of imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging technique used 'during the first week after birth to determine the extent of brain injury and predict neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with symptoms of HIE'.

'The pattern of injury in HIE depends on the severity, duration, and repetitiveness of the hypoxia-ischemia and can lead to involvement of basal ganglia, thalami, brain stem, and/or cerebral white matter in different combinations.'[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7) 'The two main patterns of injury can be distinguished with MRI in the full-term neonate':
* **Basal ganglia-thalamus pattern (BGT)**.
    * More severe hypoxia ischamia
    * 'When the baby suffers severe or total hypoxia/asphyxia, the insult is called' **acute near total or acute profound asphyxia**.
    * 'With very severe insults, there will usually be a central pattern of focal neuronal injury (deep gray matter injury) to many levels of the central nervous system, with diffuse and pronounced neuronal necrosis (death of brain cells). When the insult is relatively abrupt and severe, there will be an injury to the deep nuclear brain structures, such as the basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem.'
    * 'Children with the BGT pattern of injury tend to be severely disabled due to dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP).'
* **Watershed predominant pattern of injury (WS)**
    * Less severe hypoxia ischaemia
    * This is the other pattern of injury, also referred to as **prolonged partial or partial prolonged asphyxia**
    * This 'usually lasts for more than 30 minutes, mainleading leading to cortical injury in the watershed and parasagittal regions, with relative sparing of damage to the deep gray matter.'

MRI section based on two sources - [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs00234-010-0674-9) and [[2]](https://www.abclawcenters.com/practice-areas/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-and-brain-imaging/)

CT scans and ultrasounds can also be used but are not as sensitive / specific.[[source]](https://hiehelpcenter.org/medical/identifying-hie/tests-evaluations-screening/)

## Signs and symptoms of HIE

Signs and symptoms of HIE before birth include:
* 'Decreased fetal movement
* Severe maternal cramping (often accompanied by severe back pain)
* Abnormal fetal heart rate
* Abnormal contraction pattern
* Vaginal bleeding
* Abnormally low or high maternal weight gain
* Maternal high blood pressure'

Signs and symptoms of HIE shortly after birth (in neonates):
* 'Low Apgar scores at five or 10 minutes
* Seizures
* Difficulty feeding
* Breathing problems
* Hypotonia (low muscle tone)
* Organ problems (failure, damage)
* Acidemia (low pH in umbilical cord blood gas tests)
* Abnormal response to light
* State of abnormal consciousness (hyperalert or lethargic)
* Coma'

'In some children with HIE, especially those with mild to moderate HIE, obvious signs and symptoms of an oxygen-depriving event may not be present at the time of birth... HIE may beconme more evident later in infancy.' Signs and symptoms of HIE during infancy and early childhood:
* 'Impaired motor function
* Delayed developmental milestones
* Seizure disorder
* Delayed growth
* Hearing and visual impairments'
