# Transfer to neonatal care services

**Neonatal care services** 'provide care for all babies less than 44 weeks post menstrual age that require on-going medical care'. Each year, around 10% of all births 'will receive some type of neonatal care'.

Types of **neonatal unit**:
* **Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)**
* **Local Neonatal Unit (LNU)**
* **Special Care Unit (SCU)**

Types of care:
* **Intensive Care** - 'for babies who are the most unwell or unstable and have the greatest needs in relation to staff skills and staff to patient ratios'
* **High Dependency Care** - 'for babies who require skilled staff but where the ratio of nurse to patient is less than intensive care'
* **Special Care** - 'for babies who require additional care delivered by the neonatal service but do not require either intensive or high dependency care'
* **Transitional care** - also known as 'Special Care with Primary Carer Resident'. Either delivered by a dedicated transitional care unit or on a postnatal ward. This is when more care is needed than normal, and this is provided by the parent with support from a midwife/healthcare professional trained in 'elements of special care but does not require a specifialist neonatal qualitfication'

## Suitability as a model outcome

**Admission to any neonatal care services**

Pros:
* Want to understand as admission is expensive

Cons:
* Many of the babies will only need a short period of care and will not have poor long-term outcome

**Admission to NICU**

Pros:
* Babies admitted to NICU will be the most unstable / unwell.
* Transfer to neonatal care services can be important for cost-benefit analyses.

Cons:
* Would the reasons for admission to NICU be quite broad?
* Some datasets won't state the type of admission

`````{admonition} Suitable
:class: warning

**Admission and length of stay in NICU** is a good marker of poorly neonates - but would it be quite a wide spectrum of reasons for admission?

Admission to any neonatal care services is a poor indicator and is not suitable.
