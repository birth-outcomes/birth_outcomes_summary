# Summary

For this research project, we need to identify a **preventable adverse neonatal outcomes** - i.e. outcome impacted by obstetrician decisions during delivery. Two examples are hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) or chorioamnionitis - and for now, we have focused on HIE.

<mark>Need to add more about chorioamnionitis throughout, and markers of that?</mark>

In designing this research study, we want to explore possible outcomes that could be used to indicate that an infant has experienced HIE. The term 'outcome' is used fairly loosly to refer any indicators, including:
* Scores and measurements
* Observations
* Interventions
* Diagnoses

<mark>List below is not correct - need to update</mark>

**Most viable:**
* Cooling/moderate hypothermia
* Transfer to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
* Mechnical ventilation

**Potentially viable:**
* Neonatal resuscitation
* Low Apgar-5 score
* NNAP record of encephalopathy
* MRI with basal ganglia damage
* Diagnosis of HIE
* Death

**Not viable:**
Abnormal CTG
Low pH
Low Apgar-1 score
Transfer to any neonatal care services
Meconium-stained amniotic fluid
Intubation
Diagnosis of cerebral palsy
