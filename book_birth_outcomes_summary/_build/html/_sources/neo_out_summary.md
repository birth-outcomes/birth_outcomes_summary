# Summary

## Research into various outcomes

For this research project, we need to identify a **preventable adverse neonatal outcomes** - i.e. outcome impacted by obstetrician decisions during delivery. Two examples are hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) or chorioamnionitis - and for now, we have focused on HIE.

In designing this research study, we want to explore possible outcomes that could be used to indicate that an infant has experienced HIE. The term 'outcome' is used fairly loosly to refer any indicators, including:
* Scores and measurements
* Observations
* Interventions
* Diagnoses

As on the prior page, attempts to diagnose/define/identify HIE are varied, with several different indicators used. I have explored these indicators (and others that have been mentioned or used elsewhere) in the following pages, and made concluding recommendations for each of the outcomes, which I have copied below. This should be read **in the context of the recommendations** on the previous page, such as those from the Neonatal Data Analysis Unit and the Task Force. The method of identifying HIE could involve a single indicator or combintions (AND / OR) of indicators.

* **Therapeutic hypothermia:** Alone, this outcome is specific to HIE and should capture moderate to severe HIE cases. Requires consideration of whether certain units would be more likely to treat certain infants (either over time, or who don't meet the accepted criteria).

* **Transfer to neonatal care services** - Alone, this is not suitable as 95%+ of admitted infants will not have HIE. However, in combination with other indicators of HIE, it could support identifying more unwell infants with HIE (most unwell, if focussed on NICU).
* **Mechanical ventilation** - Potentially recommended. Half to three quarters of infants with HIE will receive mechanical ventilation - although it's important to note that these figures were all from infants who were receiving therapeutic hypothermia, so it wouldn't improve on just knowing infants received therapeutic hypothermia, and doesn't inform us on overall how many infants received it. Moreover, it woun't be the only reason infants are ventilated. Therefore, this indicator might be beneficial in combination with other indicators of HIE, but alone, is not reliable.
