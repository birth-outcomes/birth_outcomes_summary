# Summary

## Research into various outcomes

For this research project, we need to identify a **preventable adverse neonatal outcomes** - i.e. outcome impacted by obstetrician decisions during delivery. Two examples are hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) or chorioamnionitis - and for now, we have focused on HIE.

In designing this research study, we want to explore possible outcomes that could be used to indicate that an infant has experienced HIE. The term 'outcome' is used fairly loosly to refer any indicators, including:
* Scores and measurements
* Observations
* Interventions
* Diagnoses

As noted previously ("challenge 1"), the definition of HIE has often been ambiguous and variable, although there are now some recommendations aorund what evidence indicates HIE has occured (to guide diagnosis), and there is ongoing work to develop consensus definitions.


The concluding recommendations for each of the outcomes explored on the following pages and copied below.

`````{admonition} Recommended
:class: seealso

* **Therapeutic hypothermia:** Alone, this outcome is specific to HIE and should capture moderate to severe HIE cases. Requires consideration of whether certain units would be more likely to treat certain infants (either over time, or who don't meet the accepted criteria).

`````{admonition} Potentially recommended
:class: warning

* **Transfer to neonatal care services** - Alone, this is not suitable as 95%+ of admitted infants will not have HIE. However, in combination with other indicators of HIE, it could support identifying more unwell infants with HIE (most unwell, if focussed on NICU).
* **Mechanical ventilation** - Potentially recommended. Half to three quarters of infants with HIE will receive mechanical ventilation - although it's important to note that these figures were all from infants who were receiving therapeutic hypothermia, so it wouldn't improve on just knowing infants received therapeutic hypothermia, and doesn't inform us on overall how many infants received it. Moreover, it woun't be the only reason infants are ventilated. Therefore, this indicator might be beneficial in combination with other indicators of HIE, but alone, is not reliable.
