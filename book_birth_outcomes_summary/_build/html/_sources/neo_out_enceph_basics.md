# Introduction to neonatal encephalopathy (NE)

`````{admonition} Executive summary
:class: info

* Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) refers to neurological dysfunction in late pre-term or term infants, characterised by seizures, impaired consciousness, respiratory difficulties and reduced tone.
* Causes include hypoxia-ischemia, stroke, infection, intracranial hemorrhage, congenital anomalies, neurometabolic and genetic factors. NE can have a single or multiple causes.
* Approximately 1 to 6 per 1000 term births have NE. In more than half, the cause is unknown. The most common cause is hypoxia ischaemia (referred to as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy).

## Broad definition

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) refers to brain disease, damage or malfunction, as a result of perinatal brain injury. The broad clinical definition of NE is that it is:
* A neurological syndrome
* In infants born at or beyond 35 weeks of gestation (late pre-term or term)
* Characterised by:
  * Seizures
  * Impaired levels of consciousness
  * Difficulties initiating and maintaining respiration
  * Reduced tone and reflexes[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

## Causes of NE

Possible causes of NE include:
* **Hypoxia ischaemia** (most common cause, "hypoxia" means low levels of oxygen in blood flowing to tissues, and "ischaemia" means blood flow (and therefore oxygen) is restricted/reduced to tissues) (this has sometimes been referred to as asphyxia, perinatal asphyxia, or birth asphyxia - but these terminology are not recommended) (when this is the case, it is referred to as **hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy**)
* **Perinatal/neonatal stroke** (ischemic perinatal stroke (IPS) is the leading known cause of hemiplegic CP [[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpeds.2022.100025))
* **Infection** (chorioamnionitis)
* **Intracranial haemorrhage** (bleed in the skull/brain)
* **Congenital brain anomalies/malformations** (brain 'abnormalities present at birth that can result from developmental disruptions at various embryonic or fetal stages'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spen.2022.100973))
* **Neurometabolic** (extensive and diverse set of neurometabolic disorders that can impact the neonatal prain, presentation is non-specific and can mimic acquired things like HIE and sepsis. They are rare, and are primarily genetic disorders leading to disruption of enzyme activity, cellular transport, or energy production [[source]](https://journals.lww.com/topicsinmri/fulltext/2018/08000/neurometabolic_disorders_of_the_newborn.1.aspx))
* **Genetic and epigenetics factors**[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)[[Source - NHS East of England Guidelines for Management of Infants with Suspected HIE]](https://www.eoeneonatalpccsicnetwork.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HIE-Guideline.pdf)

NE **does not have to have a single cause** - for example, you could distinguish between hypoxia-ischaemia alone, a combination of other etiologies with hypoxia ischaemia, or non-HI-related etiology.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) 'Sentinel events such as cord prolapse, uterine rupture, or abruptio placentae may be clearly associated with HIE but often HIE is a **secondary** event. Therefore although hypoxia-ischemia may be involved

## Incidence estimates

These are some incidence estimates from a few difference sources.

NE:
* 1.15 million infants per annum.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)
* Affects 2 to 6 per 1000 term births.[[Russ et al. 2021]](https://doi.org/10.1542/neo.22-3-e148), or in 1-3 per 1000 term births[[Hagberg et al. 2016]](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.nbd.2015.09.011)

Unknown cause:
* In more than half of cases of encephalopathy, the cause is **unidentified**.[[Molloy et al. 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)

Hypoxia ischaemia as cause of NE:
* Hypoxia ischaemia contributes to approximately 29% of neonatal encephalopathy.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)
* Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy accounts for 1.5 per 1000 term births.[[Russ et al. 2021]](https://doi.org/10.1542/neo.22-3-e148)
* Hypoxia ischaemia is known to be 'the sole instigator of encephalopathy in an estimated 7% of infants with NE. The Vermont Oxford Network Neonatal Encephalopathy Registry found that an asphyxia event accounted for 15% and inflammation 24% of cases of NE with other maternal etiologies also implicated'.[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)
* 'Some authors state that HIE is the cause of NE in 50%â€“80% of cases based on clinical, EEG, and MRI criteria.'[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)

The greatest burden of NE is in **low-middle-income** countries.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)
