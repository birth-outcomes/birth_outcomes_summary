# Cooling / Moderate Hypothermia

'**Therapeutic hypothermia is currently the only neuroprotective treatment that has been proven to reduce death and neurological sequelae in term infants with moderate to severe HIE**.' It must be started within 6 hours of birth.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fdiagnostics12030645)

'Hypothermia treatment is delivered through either selective head or whole body cooling of the infant... decreasing the infant's body temperature to between 33°C and 36.5°C. Infants are generally cooled for 48 to 72 hours and then rewarmed slowly to prevent complications (e.g., hypotension).'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004)

It works by minimising 'the production of toxic substances that can cause brain injury. When the brain does not have enough oxygen or energy to function, it produces toxic chemicals which can ultimately damage a baby’s brain. When oxygen is restored to the brain, there is a time period where the brain attempts to recover from the injury. Unfortunately, a second wave of toxic chemicals is often released, which can further injure the brain. Because of this, the majority of brain damage can occur during and after restoration of blood flow and oxygen to the brain – not necessarily during birth. Once the cooling therapy is completed, we slowly warm the baby back up to inhibit the production of additional chemicals and reduce the risk of brain damage.'[[source]](https://utswmed.org/medblog/total-body-cooling-saving-babies-lives-after-emergency-delivery/)

'Many infants still experience adverse outcomes despite cooling, including cerebral palsy (CP), cognitive, visual or hearing impairment, and even death. Moreover, a significant proportion of infants with mild HIE, who are currently not eligible for therapeutic hypothermia, have an adverse outcome at follow-up.'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fdiagnostics12030645)

'A Cochrane systematic review of 11 randomised controlled trials has shown this therapy reduces death and neurodisability in infants with moderate to severe encephalopathy. Despite 46% of infants having developed adverse events related to cooling, it is now the standard treatment for neonatal encephalopathy in high-income countries (HiCs).'[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

'The recent HELIX (hypothermia for moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy in low-income and middle-income countries) study showed that not only did therapeutic hypothermia not decrease the combined outcome of death or disability in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, it significantly increased mortality alone'.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) As a result, treatments are now being investigated as stand-alone treatments or adjuvants to therapeutic hypothermia (e.g. erythropoietin, darbepoetin).[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

## Suitability as a model outcome

Pros:
* As far as have understood it, this treatment is only given to infants when doctors believe they have moderate to severe HIE, so it should be a confident marker of a sick baby, sick enough to warrant this treatment.

Cons:
* Wouldn't include mild HIE
* Choice to cool will still vary between clinicians in spit of guidelines - implementation has not been consistent around the country, and there has been alot of change - if you look over time, there will be changes in choice to cool.

Anecdotally, cooling 1 in 200.

## Conclusion

`````{admonition} Suitable
:class: seealso

Should be a good marker of moderate to severe HIE - but there may still be some variation between obstetricians in choice to use cooling, and over time.
