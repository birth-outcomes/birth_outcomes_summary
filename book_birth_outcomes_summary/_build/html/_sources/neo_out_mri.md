## MRI and patterns of injury in HIE

In terms of imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging technique used 'during the first week after birth to determine the extent of brain injury and predict neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with symptoms of HIE'.

'The pattern of injury in HIE depends on the severity, duration, and repetitiveness of the hypoxia-ischemia and can lead to involvement of basal ganglia, thalami, brain stem, and/or cerebral white matter in different combinations.'[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7) 'The two main patterns of injury can be distinguished with MRI in the full-term neonate':
* **Basal ganglia-thalamus pattern (BGT)**.
    * More severe hypoxia ischamia
    * 'When the baby suffers severe or total hypoxia/asphyxia, the insult is called' **acute near total or acute profound asphyxia**.
    * 'With very severe insults, there will usually be a central pattern of focal neuronal injury (deep gray matter injury) to many levels of the central nervous system, with diffuse and pronounced neuronal necrosis (death of brain cells). When the insult is relatively abrupt and severe, there will be an injury to the deep nuclear brain structures, such as the basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem.'
    * 'Children with the BGT pattern of injury tend to be severely disabled due to dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP).'
* **Watershed predominant pattern of injury (WS)**
    * Less severe hypoxia ischaemia
    * This is the other pattern of injury, also referred to as **prolonged partial or partial prolonged asphyxia**
    * This 'usually lasts for more than 30 minutes, mainleading leading to cortical injury in the watershed and parasagittal regions, with relative sparing of damage to the deep gray matter.'

CT scans and ultrasounds can also be used but are not as sensitive / specific.[[source]](https://hiehelpcenter.org/medical/identifying-hie/tests-evaluations-screening/)
