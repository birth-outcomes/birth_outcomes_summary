# Cerebral palsy

'Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurologic disability affecting body movement, muscle tone, and posture'. It 'is caused by damage or developmental defects to the areas of the brain that control the movement of the body and coordination.' There are four types: spastic CP, dyskinetic CP, ataxic CP and mixed CP.[[source]](https://www.birthinjuryhelpcenter.org/cerebral-palsy.html)

'The abnormal development of the brain or damage that leads to CP can happen before birth, during birth, within a month after birth, or during the first years of a child’s life, while the brain is still developing.' It can be classified as:
* **Congenital CP** - if related to development/damage 'that occurred before or during birth' - this is the majority (85-90%)
* **Acquired CP** - if related to development/damage that occurred 'more than 28 days after birth' - usually 'an infection (e.g. meningitis) or head injury'[[source]](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/facts.html)

Causes include:
* **Oxygen deprivation (asphyxia)** - a 'wide range of obstetrical complications and events during pregnancy can threaten the supply of oxygen to the baby's brain'
* **Infections** - 'infections during pregnancy, labour and delivery can potentially cause damage to the baby's brain', including viral infections (eg. rubella, cytomegalovirus) and parasitic infections (eg. toxoplasmosis) - as well as 'infections of the placental membranes and amniotic fluids (chorioamnionitis)'
* **Premature birth** - premature babies 'are 30 times more likely to be diagnosed with cerebral palsy' - this is often because 'premature babies frequently experience brain haemorrhages and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)', which cause brain damage that can lead to cerebral palsy
* **C-section delays** - if there are complications 'during labour and delivery, a timely emergency c-section can be the only way to avoid oxygen deprivation and brain damage to the baby'. 'Even a very short delay in performing a c-section can damage the baby's brain and result in cerebral palsy. This is likely the leading cause for birth injuries from cerebral palsy leading to a medical malpractice lawsuit'
* **Head trauma** - 'external trauma to the baby's head during childbirth can potentially cause the type of brain damage that results in cerebral palsy'[[source]](https://www.birthinjuryhelpcenter.org/cerebral-palsy.html)

'Cerebral palsy is one of the most costly neurologic disabilities because of its frequency (2/1000 births) and persistence over the life span.'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.clp.2009.07.011)

'In order to define international criteria to establish a causal link between intrapartum hypoxic events and CP, the ACOG Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy recommended a multidimensional assessment process for NE and defined diagnostic criteria, based on the premise that NE due to acute hypoxia-ischemia will be accompanied by abnormal neonatal signs and be associated with contributing events in close temporal proximity to labor and delivery. NE does not necessarily lead to permanent neurologic impairment, but it is a prerequisite to making association between intrapartum injury and CP'.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpeds.2022.100025)

## Suitability as a model outcome

Cons:
* Diagnosis often later in childhood, so unlikely to be in neonatal datasets
* Won't be able to distinguish congenital and acquired CP in the data
* Only around 15% of cases of CP are attributable to intrapartum hypoxia–ischemia[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2022.04.021)
* CP is only one of the possible outcomes of fetal hypoxia[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2022.04.021)
