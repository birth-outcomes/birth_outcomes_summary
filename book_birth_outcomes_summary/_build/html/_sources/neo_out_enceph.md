# Neonatal encephalopathy diagnosis

Presently, there are two key challenges to be aware of in this field:
* Creating a consensus definition for neonatal encephalopathy, subclassifying subtypes, and stratifying trial entry criteria based on aetiology
* Standardising outcome reporting across studies, irrespective of underlying aetiology or type of treatment being investigated - faciliating evidence synthesis through systematic review and meta-analysis, enhancing our understanding of intervention effects[[Devane et al. 2024]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-03006-1)

## Broad definition of neonatal encephalopathy

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) refers to brain disease, damage or malfunction, as a result of perinatal brain injury. The broad clinical definition of NE is that it is:
* A neurological syndrome
* In infants born at or beyond 35 weeks of gestation (late pre-term or term)
* Characterised by:
  * Seizures
  * Impaired levels of consciousness
  * Difficulties initiating and maintaining respiration
  * Reduced tone and reflexes[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

Possible causes of NE include:
* **Hypoxia ischaemia** (most common cause, "hypoxia" means low levels of oxygen in blood flowing to tissues, and "ischaemia" means blood flow (and therefore oxygen) is restricted/reduced to tissues) (this has sometimes been referred to as asphyxia, perinatal asphyxia, or birth asphyxia - but these terminology are not recommended)
* **Perinatal/neonatal stroke** (ischemic perinatal stroke (IPS) is the leading known cause of hemiplegic CP [[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpeds.2022.100025))
* **Infection** (chorioamnionitis)
* **Intracranial haemorrhage** (bleed in the skull/brain)
* **Congenital brain anomalies/malformations** (brain 'abnormalities present at birth that can result from developmental disruptions at various embryonic or fetal stages'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spen.2022.100973))
* **Neurometabolic** (extensive and diverse set of neurometabolic disorders that can impact the neonatal prain, presentation is non-specific and can mimic acquired things like HIE and sepsis. They are rare, and are primarily genetic disorders leading to disruption of enzyme activity, cellular transport, or energy production [[source]](https://journals.lww.com/topicsinmri/fulltext/2018/08000/neurometabolic_disorders_of_the_newborn.1.aspx))
* **Genetic and epigenetics factors**[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)[[Source - NHS East of England Guidelines for Management of Infants with Suspected HIE]](https://www.eoeneonatalpccsicnetwork.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HIE-Guideline.pdf)

'A diagnosis of NE does not commit to a specific etiology or pathogenesis and can develop following a constellation of maternal factors, familial factors, genetic predisposition, HIE, infections, placental abnormalities, thrombophilia, coagulation defects, and metabolic disorders. A postulated NE terminology can be proposed at birth such as (1) hypoxic NE, (2) inflammatory NE, (3) infectious NE, (4) metabolic NE. Neuroimaging using magnetic resonance imaging, conventional, diffusion, and spectroscopy gives a useful guide regarding the potential timing of a cerebral insult especially diffusion abnormalities. Abnormalities from a cerebral injury become most evident after 5–7 days using qualitative MRI, and diffusion and spectroscopy are useful to determine the time of the insult.9 Blood cultures and placental pathology can identify infectious and inflammatory etiologies. Genetic and metabolic causes can be indicated if a different pattern of brain injury is detected by neuroimaging such as porencephaly, focal arterial infarction, or atypical patterns. Recognizing the etiology of NE involved can also guide investigations such as metabolic and sepsis workups to ensure optimal management.'[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

NE does not have to have a single cause - for example, you could distinguish between hypoxia-ischaemia alone, a combination of other etiologies with hypoxia ischaemia, or non-HI-related etiology.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) 'Sentinel events such as cord prolapse, uterine rupture, or abruptio placentae may be clearly associated with HIE but often HIE is a secondary event. Therefore although hypoxia-ischemia may be involved, it is known to be the sole instigator of encephalopathy in an estimated 7% of infants with NE. The Vermont Oxford Network Neonatal Encephalopathy Registry found that an asphyxia event accounted for 15% and inflammation 24 % of cases of NE with other maternal etiologies also implicated'.[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)

## Incidence

These are some incidence estimates from a few difference sources.

NE:
* 1.15 million infants per annum.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)
* Affects 2 to 6 per 1000 term births.[[Russ et al. 2021]](https://doi.org/10.1542/neo.22-3-e148), or in 1-3 per 1000 term births[[Hagberg et al. 2016]](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.nbd.2015.09.011)

Cause of NE:
* Hypoxia ischaemia contributes to approximately 29% of neonatal encephalopathy.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)1.5 per 1000 term births.[[Russ et al. 2021]](https://doi.org/10.1542/neo.22-3-e148) 
* HIE accounts for 
* In more than half of cases of encephalopathy, the cause is unidentified.[[Molloy et al. 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)
* 'Some authors state that HIE is the cause of NE in 50%–80% of cases based on clinical, EEG, and MRI criteria.'[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)

The greatest burden of NE is in low-middle-income countries.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

## Ambiguity in the definitions of NE and HIE

### How is there ambiguity?

The definition for neonatal encephalopathy above does not **does not specify subgroups, etiology, or guide management**. This ambiguity has been criticised as hindering case definition, collaborative research, and data synthesis and confusing families and caregivers.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

Moreover, the terms "neonatal encephalopathy" and "hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy" have often been **used interchangeably**, which is misleading, as HIE is actually a sub-group of NE. In practice, NE can occassionally be mistaked for HIE at birth. Also, congential neuromuscular disorders can be mistaken for NE (if they are disorders that involve abnormal tone,movements, and respiratory insufficiency).[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

A systematic review of 67 RCTs from 1998 to 2022 found notable variation in terminology - 56/67 referred to HIE, whilst 16 referred to NE - and yet the most common inclusion criteria were not necessarily specific to HIE - Apgar scores, metabolic acidosis, reduced level of consciousness, reduced tone, and abnormal reflexes.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

### Why is this important?

It is beneficial to understand the aetiology of NE. It can lead to the development of targeted adjunctive therapies related to the underlying mechanism and development of preventative strategies.[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9) 'NE could be stratified by etiology. Subclassification and consensus definition will allow better collaboration and development of appropriate therapies for each subgroup, as a single “magic bullet” therapy is unlikely to treat all potential causes of NE.'[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

It is also important when we might do harm by attributing a cause (e.g. hypoxia ischemia) to the disorder (encephalopathy).[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

Clear diagnosis is crucial for parents to help them to access accurate prognostic information and support.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

An early diagnosis is also crucial - as, for example, treatment with therapeutic hypothermia must be within the first six hours of injury for optimum benefit.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

### What are the challenges?

Diagnosis of HIE or asphyxia is often over-utilised in practice and not clinically justified by the limited data at birth.[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

**Identifying the precise causal pathway is often challenging**. 'Careful clinical phenotyping may help differentiation of NE by cause. This requires examination of the obstetric course and fetal monitoring records; careful and repeated neurological examination; early multichannel EEG or aEEG recordings of background brain activity; MRI and ultrasound brain imaging; and microbiological, biochemical and genetic analysis to rule out sepsis, inborn errors of metabolism, or epileptic encephalopathies, where indicated'.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

For HIE, it is also **difficult to quantify the dose, duration and severity** of hypoxia ischaemia. However, it is also important that a consensus definition is reached for mild HE, which has been variably defined. This is particular as the risk/benefit of providing therapeutic hypothermia to mild NE is not yet well characterised and trials are required.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

## Recommendations

### Definition of HIE from the American Colleges of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Pediatrics (ACOG-AAP) Task Force

The American Colleges of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Pediatrics (ACOG-AAP) task force defined HIE as a **restrospectively designated diagnosis - i.e. you start with a diagnosis of NE** and then subsequency - based on accumulated evidence - subclassify it as HIE. Their recommend that a diagnosis includes:

1. The presence of a **sentinel hypoxic or ischemic event** occurring immediately before, during or after birth - e.g. a rupture uterus, severe abruption placentae, or fetal heart rate monitor patterns consistent with an acute peripartum or intrapartum event

2. The presence of **fetal acidosis** ((pH < 7.0 or base deficit ≥12 mmol/L)) **low Apgar** scores (Apgar score <5 at 5 and 10 min)

3. Evidence of **multiple organ dysfunction** affecting the heart, liver, or kidneys

4. **Neuroimaging evidence** of acute brain injury with MRI or magnetic resonance spectroscopy, (a) consistent with hypoxia ischaemia and excluding other causes, and (b) consistent with acute peripartum or intrapartum event (i.e. timing)[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9) [[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

This definition may exclude some cases of HIE due to factors like:
* Milder acidosis
* Higher Apgar scores
* Non-classical patterns of injury on MRI
* Progressive, subacute evolution of HIE
* Incomplete data, such as outcomes that do not include severe motor deficit
* Incomplete data collection[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

### Establishing causal relationship with cerebral palsy from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy

In order to establish a **causal relationship** between an acute intrapartum interruption of placental blood flow and later cerebral palsy, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy require:

1. Evidence of **metabolic acidosis** in fetal umbilical cord arterial blood obtained at delivery

2. **Early onset of NE**

3. **Spastic quadriplegia or dyskinetic** type of cerebral palsy

4. **Exclusion** of other identifiable etiologies such as trauma, coagulation disorders, infectious conditions, or genetic disorders[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

### Initial diagnosis of NE

'It is difficult to prove the presence of cerebral hypoxic ischemia with the exception of well characterized animal models and particular cases of neonatal stroke.'
[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)

'As such, many prominent bodies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM), advocate for using NE until the exact aetiology is determined.'[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y) This means that using descriptive terminology like NE is preferable in the newborn period, before workup and course are known, rather than an etiology-based definition like HIE, which implies a single known etiology.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) Clinical categorization, such as NE caused by sepsis, genetic causes, stroke, or those with a multifocal origin is required to ensure targeted management where possible for non-HIE causes.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) 

### DEFiNE

'An international evidence-based consensus is required to define NE, classify the subgroups, and their diagnostic criteria.' **The DEFiNE group has 'developed a protocol for a consensus definition of NE.** The evidence synthesis has started with a systematic review of definitions of NE used in randomized controlled trials involving patients with NE. This has revealed a huge disparity between, and little consensus on, definitions of NE. The next stage is to complete a protocol for a study to develop an international and multidisciplinary consensus definition using a modified Delphi consensus approach. The Delphi approach is an iterative process with repeated rounds of evaluation and voting to help determine consensus among a group of experts and parents with different levels of knowledge and expertise. We will use an online real-time Delphi approach to arrive at a consensus definition.'[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

## Outcomes of neonatal encephalopathy

NE is associated with mortality and long-term disabilities like cerebral palsy and other developmental impairments.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

'A significant obstacle in determining the effectiveness of new treatments for neonatal encephalopathy is the lack of standardisation in the outcomes measured and reported in randomised trials.' 'This heterogeneity in outcome reporting can be minimised by developing a core outcome set (COS). A COS is an agreed standardised set of outcomes that should be measured and reported as a minimum in all studies related to a particular health condition. Other outcomes may be measured and reported by trialists, but the COS is the minimum number of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all studies.'[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

### COHESION

'The COHESION Steering Group was formed in January 2019. It included neonatologists, obstetricians, midwives, a neonatal nurse practitioner, parent (i.e. public and patient involvement (PPI) representatives), experts in COS development and researchers with expertise in neonatal encephalopathy. The collective knowledge of this group informed the planning, design, and development of this COS.'

They performed a systemtic review, identifying 66 unique outcomes. They delivered Delphi surveys with 269 participants (parents of infants with NE or HIE, and relevant healthcare providers) who were asked to rate the outcomes. They then conducted a series of consensus review meetings. The final core outcome set was:
* **Survival**
* **Brain injury on imaging**
* **Neurological status at discharge**
* **Cerebral palsy**
* **General cognitive ability**
* **Quality of life of the child**
* **Adverse events**

They recommend that these outcomes are used in future studies evaluating NE treatments. Note that this study focussed on definiting outcomes for NE (not specifically HIE).
