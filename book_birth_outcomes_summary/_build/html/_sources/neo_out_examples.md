## NDAU work on brain injuries during or soon after birth

The Department of Health commissioned the Neonatal Data Analysis Unit (NDAU) at Imperial College London to extract data from the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) and to calculate annual rates for Brain injuries occurring during or soon after birth for England from 2010 to 2015. As part of this work, they had to develop a definition and methodology for identifying brain injury. The working definition is copied below (as well as on the prior page about definitions of NE & HIE).

This group definied **brain injuries occurring during or soon after birth** as followed:
* Population - all babies admitted to a neonatal unit
* Time period after birth - all brain injuries detected during neonatal unit stay
* Conditions included -
    - **Signs** consistent with **neonatal encephalopathy** in term or near term infants (**altered tone, altered consciousness, seizures**)
    - **Diagnosis** of intracranial haemorrhage, perinatal stroke, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE), central nervous system infection, or kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) in any infants
    - Preterm white matter disease (periventricular leukomalacia) in pre-term infants
* Denominator - all live births
* Exclusions - congenital encephalopathies (including inborn errors of metabolism), congenital infections, and congenital brain abnormalities

However, they found that data on signs of NE were not consistent over time - the fields used to define "altered tone" and "altered consciousness" only began from October 2010 onwards. Therefore, for this project, they dropped those and just looked for "seizures".

### Identifying and defining HIE

In the briefing paper circulated before their meeting, they note that the current definition used by Each Baby Counts (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists national quality improvement programme) is:
* Greater than or equal to 37 weeks gestation at birth
* Any of the following diagnosis codes entered into Diagnosis at discharge field:
    * Severe Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE)
    * Severe Neonatal Encephalopathy
    * Grade 3 Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE)
* OR meet one of the following criteria from daily variables, within first 7 days:
    * Decreased central tone and comatose and seizures
    * Received therapeutic hypothermia (cooling)
    * Receiving diagnosis (daily data variable) of severe (grade 3) Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE)

They note that defining HIE by treatment means:
* It will include infants who do not develop detectable brain injury
* It may discourage use of treatment in borderline cases

In the briefing paper, they offer some options of definitions to be considered, for HIE these were:
* Daily variables observed within first 72 hours, and therapeutic hypothermia needs to be received for 3 consecutive days

The decision decided upon in their consensus meeting for HIE was:
* **Diagnosis of NE or HIE (severe, moderate, grade 2 or grade 3)**
* **Therapeutic hypothermia for 2 or more consecutive days**
