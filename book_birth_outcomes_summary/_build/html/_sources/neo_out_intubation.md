# Intubation

**Intubation**, also known as **tracheal or endotracheal intubation** is the insertion of a breathing tube into the trachea.[[source]](https://elht.nhs.uk/application/files/7016/6721/3334/Critical_Care_Procedures_and_Treatments_document_JULY_2022.pdf) **Endotracheal suctioning** is a common procedure on intubated infants 'to clear secretions and maintain the airway patency'.[[source]](https://www.rch.org.au/rchcpg/hospital_clinical_guideline_index/endotracheal_tube_suction_of_ventilated_neonates/)

In the 1980s and 1990s, 'all infants born through MSAF (both vigorous and non-vigorous) were routinely intubated after delivery', and intervention decisions were 'based on the consistency and thickness of the meconium'.

In 2000, the fourth edition of the Neonatal Resuscitation programme (NRP) guidelines stopped recommending intubation 'for vigorous infants born through MSAF'.

In 2016, the seventh edition of the NRP guidelines stopped recommending 'routine intubation and tracheal suctioning for non-vigorous infants born through MSAF'. This was on the basis of a lack of evidence to support intubation and tracheal suctioning, 'in the context of avoiding the potential harm of intubation and the subsequent delay in initiating the initial steps of neonatal resuscitation'.

We understand that now intubation and suctioning is only used if you are actively resuscitating and unable to move the chest.

## Suitability as a model outcome

Using intubation as an indicator for meconium at delivery would not be a viable outcome as newborns are no longer intubated for this. In historical data, you would see a shift from it being used to not.

<mark>is it done for other reasons though? do we mind whether its meconium or not?</mark>

No longer perform for meconium.
