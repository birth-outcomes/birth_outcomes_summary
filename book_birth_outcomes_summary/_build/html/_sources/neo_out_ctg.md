# Abnormal CTG

<mark> sort this out </mark>

Hypoxic events trigger the fetal sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, so variations in FHR can be monitored to detect signs of fetal compromise.[[source]](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/10/9/1007)

'Cardiotocography (CTG) was introduced in the 1960s to detect fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns thought to indicate hypoxia. However, its value has been an ongoing topic of debate. A Cochrane review of trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of the intrapartum CTG showed that although the use of CTG is associated with a reduction in neonatal seizures it does not prevent perinatal death or cerebral palsy. Furthermore, CTG monitoring has been associated with rising cesarean section rates which are independently associated with maternal risks.'

'A key issue with the use of CTG is interpretation. Several reports have suggested CTG misinterpretation as the main contributory cause in preventable cases of HIE and perinatal deaths. There are different guidelines worldwide for CTG interpretation. There is not only substantial inter-observer disagreement using individual guidelines but also poor agreement when the comparison is made across different guidelines. Furthermore, some experts argue that looking at CTG based on pattern recognition alone with emphasis on FHR decelerations results in unnecessary interventions for non-acidotic babies who mount normal responses to hypoxia and has no correlation with neonatal outcomes.'

'During labor the fetus is intermittently deprived of O<sub>2</sub>, with a fall of 5% to 10% in oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) below baseline when the intrauterine pressure exceeds approximately 30 mm Hg during myometrial contractions. At 35 mm Hg of intrauterine pressure, which is the level at which we can usually feel the contractions on the abdominal wall, the uteroplacental blood flow disappears at the end of diastole, and at 60 mm Hg diastolic flow ceases completely. The occurrence of FHR decelerations accompanied by transient shunting of blood from peripheral to central organs during such O<sub>2</sub> deprivation is a normal physiological fetal response, known as the “diving reflex” in aquatic mammals and birds. The diving reflex thus strives to preserve an aerobic metabolism in central organs, provided by the concomitant metabolic down-regulation in peripheral organs. In a fetus already suffering a baseline O<sub>2</sub> deficit when at rest, such as with placental insufficiency in fetal growth restriction (FGR), the superimposed hypoxic stress by uterine contractions may progressively cause severe hypoxia, acidosis, and severe FHR decelerations. A loss of umbilical artery end-diastolic flow may then appear during both variable and late FHR decelerations. The umbilical artery flow resistance increases concomitantly which further compromises the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion across the placental membranes. The lowest SaO<sub>2</sub> is reached at the end of a contraction, and it takes up to 2 minutes after the peak of contraction to recover to baseline. Thus, when >5 labor contractions per 10 minutes occur, a full recovery might not be reached between contractions, and a superimposed fetal hypoxemia (low blood oxygen) develops. An intact fetus resists the strain of normal labor, but with tachysystole (>5 contractions every 10 minutes) a critical limit might be reached, which then also affects a previously healthy fetus.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2022.07.001)

• The presence of FHR accelerations (either spontaneous or stimulated) reliably predicts the absence of fetal metabolic acidemia at the time it is observed. • Moderate FHR variability reliably predicts the absence of metabolic acidemia at the time it is observed • The absence of accelerations does not reliably predict fetal acidemia • Minimal or absent FHR variability alone does not reliably predict the presence of fetal hypoxemia or acidemia • NICHD, 2008 • Remember: • Minimal variability may reflect fetal sleep, narcotics, or other drugs[[source]](https://admin.learningstream.com/files/DA1537B2-387C-452A-890E-A227518D8EB6_9/94228/5FetalAcidbase.pdf)

## Suitability as a model outcome

Cons:
* High intra- and inter-observer variability in CTG interpretation
* Record of abnormal CTG may be inconsistent/lack detail beyond just "it was abnormal" - in which case, would need the raw CTG and to identify what was abnormal - and that may not be what the obstetrician thought was abnormal

## Conclusion

`````{admonition} Unsuitable
:class: error

There is high intra- and inter-observer variability in CTG interpretation and although a consensus opinion would improve the outcome's validity, the poor association between an abnormal CTG and adverse neonatal outcomes ultimately means this would not be an appropriate outcome. Note: Although we don't want to use it as an outcome to tell us HIE as occurred, we can use it as a risk factor to help predict occurence of HIE.
