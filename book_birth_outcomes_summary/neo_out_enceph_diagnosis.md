# Challenge 1: Identifying the type of NE - in particular, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)

## What are the challenges in identifying the cause of NE?

Diagnosis of HIE or asphyxia is often over-utilised in practice and not clinically justified by the limited data at birth.[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

**Identifying the precise causal pathway is often challenging**. 'Careful clinical phenotyping may help differentiation of NE by cause. This requires examination of the obstetric course and fetal monitoring records; careful and repeated neurological examination; early multichannel EEG or aEEG recordings of background brain activity; MRI and ultrasound brain imaging; and microbiological, biochemical and genetic analysis to rule out sepsis, inborn errors of metabolism, or epileptic encephalopathies, where indicated'.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

For HIE, it is also **difficult to quantify the dose, duration and severity** of hypoxia ischaemia. However, it is also important that a consensus definition is reached for mild HE, which has been variably defined. This is particular as the risk/benefit of providing therapeutic hypothermia to mild NE is not yet well characterised and trials are required.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

## What is the problem with the terminology?

The definition for neonatal encephalopathy (as presented on the last page) does not **does not specify subgroups, etiology, or guide management**. This ambiguity has been criticised as hindering case definition, collaborative research, and data synthesis and confusing families and caregivers.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

Moreover, the terms "neonatal encephalopathy" and "hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy" have often been **used interchangeably**, which is misleading, as HIE is actually a sub-group of NE. In practice, NE can occassionally be mistaked for HIE at birth. Also, congential neuromuscular disorders can be mistaken for NE (if they are disorders that involve abnormal tone,movements, and respiratory insufficiency).[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

A systematic review of 67 RCTs from 1998 to 2022 found notable variation in terminology - 56/67 referred to HIE, whilst 16 referred to NE - and yet the most common inclusion criteria were not necessarily specific to HIE - Apgar scores, metabolic acidosis, reduced level of consciousness, reduced tone, and abnormal reflexes.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

## Why is this important?

It is beneficial to understand the aetiology of NE. It can lead to the development of targeted adjunctive therapies related to the underlying mechanism and development of preventative strategies.[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9) 'NE could be stratified by etiology. Subclassification and consensus definition will allow better collaboration and development of appropriate therapies for each subgroup, as a single “magic bullet” therapy is unlikely to treat all potential causes of NE.'[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

It is also important when we might do harm by attributing a cause (e.g. hypoxia ischemia) to the disorder (encephalopathy).[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

Clear diagnosis is crucial for parents to help them to access accurate prognostic information and support.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

An early diagnosis is also crucial - as, for example, treatment with therapeutic hypothermia must be within the first six hours of injury for optimum benefit.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

## Recommendations

### Definition of HIE from the American Colleges of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Pediatrics (ACOG-AAP) Task Force

The American Colleges of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Pediatrics (ACOG-AAP) task force defined HIE as a **restrospectively designated diagnosis - i.e. you start with a diagnosis of NE** and then subsequency - based on accumulated evidence - subclassify it as HIE. Their recommend that a diagnosis includes:

1. The presence of a **sentinel hypoxic or ischemic event** occurring immediately before, during or after birth - e.g. a rupture uterus, severe abruption placentae, or fetal heart rate monitor patterns consistent with an acute peripartum or intrapartum event

2. The presence of **fetal acidosis** ((pH < 7.0 or base deficit ≥12 mmol/L)) **low Apgar** scores (Apgar score <5 at 5 and 10 min)

3. Evidence of **multiple organ dysfunction** affecting the heart, liver, or kidneys

4. **Neuroimaging evidence** of acute brain injury with MRI or magnetic resonance spectroscopy, (a) consistent with hypoxia ischaemia and excluding other causes, and (b) consistent with acute peripartum or intrapartum event (i.e. timing)[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9) [[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

This definition may exclude some cases of HIE due to factors like:
* Milder acidosis
* Higher Apgar scores
* Non-classical patterns of injury on MRI
* Progressive, subacute evolution of HIE
* Incomplete data, such as outcomes that do not include severe motor deficit
* Incomplete data collection[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

### Establishing causal relationship with cerebral palsy from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy

In order to establish a **causal relationship** between an acute intrapartum interruption of placental blood flow and later cerebral palsy, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy require:

1. Evidence of **metabolic acidosis** in fetal umbilical cord arterial blood obtained at delivery

2. **Early onset of NE**

3. **Spastic quadriplegia or dyskinetic** type of cerebral palsy

4. **Exclusion** of other identifiable etiologies such as trauma, coagulation disorders, infectious conditions, or genetic disorders[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

### Initial diagnosis of NE and then HIE

'It is difficult to prove the presence of cerebral hypoxic ischemia with the exception of well characterized animal models and particular cases of neonatal stroke.'
[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)

'As such, many prominent bodies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM), advocate for using NE until the exact aetiology is determined.'[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y) This means that using descriptive terminology like NE is preferable in the newborn period, before workup and course are known, rather than an etiology-based definition like HIE, which implies a single known etiology.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) Clinical categorization, such as NE caused by sepsis, genetic causes, stroke, or those with a multifocal origin is required to ensure targeted management where possible for non-HIE causes.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) 

### The DEFiNE group

'An international evidence-based consensus is required to define NE, classify the subgroups, and their diagnostic criteria.' **The DEFiNE group has 'developed a protocol for a consensus definition of NE.** The evidence synthesis has started with a systematic review of definitions of NE used in randomized controlled trials involving patients with NE. This has revealed a huge disparity between, and little consensus on, definitions of NE. The next stage is to complete a protocol for a study to develop an international and multidisciplinary consensus definition using a modified Delphi consensus approach. The Delphi approach is an iterative process with repeated rounds of evaluation and voting to help determine consensus among a group of experts and parents with different levels of knowledge and expertise. We will use an online real-time Delphi approach to arrive at a consensus definition.'[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)
