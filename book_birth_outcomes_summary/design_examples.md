# Examples of studies that account for the treatment paradox

## Commentary on prognostic models in obstetrics

'Historically, the field of obstetrics has been successful in developing prediction models but has been poor in fully validating and thus implementing them effectively... Only two thirds of the papers [62.4%, 164/263] in a large systematic review of prognostic models in obstetrics were found to have presented their models in such a way that external validation would be feasible. This has been highlighted as a concern given the importance of validity in the development of such models.'[[Murphy et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.87311)

'Certain models can be too complex for routine clinical usage and this may lead to a reluctance on the part of the clinicians to accept them... It is also important that models which have been developed are also validated in a new population as otherwise it may not be possible to generalise them to a different cohort of patients. This is also known as impact analysis and this paper by Reilly et al. highlights that very few prediction models have undergone formal impact analysis or validation. This is essential in order for clinicians to know if the usage of such a model will have a positive or negative effect, i.e. is there a possibility that it will cause harm. The authors highlighted the benefit of having clinicians involved in the development and validation of such models before, during and after implementation.'[[Murphy et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.87311)

## Are there examples of studies of neonatal outcomes that have attempted to account for the treatment paradox?

### PREP model

**Model:** Development and validation of Prediction models for Risks of complications in Early-onset Pre-eclampsia.[[Thangaratinam et al. 2017]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-017-0827-3)

This is a prediction model for pre-eclampsia that has been successfully validated. In a 2016 commentary in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (BJOG)[[Cheong-See et al. 2016]](https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.13859), they examined this model to identify what made it succesful and highlighted:
* Large sample size
* Standardisation of treatment or intervention
* Consideration of the initiation of treatment being an outcome itself - i.e. "when starting a treatment is likely to prevent an adverse outcome, those who received the treatment could also be considered to have experienced the outcome"[[Murphy et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.87311)

### Other

**Incorporation of treatment in the model:** 'In the prediction of metabolic acidosis in neonates (example 1) there could be an intervention effect present owing to cesarean delivery. An unexpected finding was observed for the relation between intrapartum fever and metabolic acidosis (OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.68–1.08]). Upon inclusion of cesarean delivery in the model, intrapartum fever was positively related to metabolic acidosis (OR 1.08 [95% CI 0.86–1.34]), which was in line with expectations.'[[Schuit et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.120812)

**Including an alternative outcome not impacted by treatment paradox:** By including abnormal CTG as a neonatal outcome (alongside stillbirth, early neonatal death, mean birthweight, incidence of small-for-gestational age, neonatal unit admission, and composite of Apgar5<7, pH<7 or neonatal encephalopathy).[[Bhatia et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.13671)
