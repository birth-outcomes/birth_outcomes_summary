ROUGH NOTES...

## Additional: counterfactual prediction modelling

In the case of **counterfactual prediction modelling** (which answers ‘what if’ questions on prognosis related to interventions) **prediction and etiology intentionally collide**.[[Ramspek et al. 2021]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00794-w)

### When can prediction models answer causal questions?

As this example is from a simulation study where know true causal effects, we can plot the SHAP values from the prediction models v.s. the known true causal effects.

We can also add clustering to see the redundancy structure of the data as a dendrogram - 'when features merge together at the bottom (left) of the dendrogram it means that that the information those features contain about the outcome (renewal) is very redundant and the model could have used either feature. When features merge together at the top (right) of the dendrogram it means the information they contain about the outcome is independent from each other.'

**When can predictive models answer causal questions?** When the feature is independent of (a) other features in the model, and (b) unobserved confounders. Hence, it is not subject to bias from either unmeasured confounders or feature redundancy. Example: Economy
* Independent from other features in dendogram (no observed confounding)
* No unobserved confounding in causal digram

**When can they not be used? (1) When you have observed confounding.** Example: Ad Spend (no direct causal effect on retention, but correlated with Last upgrade and Monthly usage which do drive retention). 'Our predictive model identifies Ad Spend as the one of the best single predictors of retention because it captures so many of the true causal drivers through correlations. XGBoost imposes regularization, which is a fancy way of saying that it tries to choose the simplest possible model that still predicts well. If it could predict equally well using one feature rather than three, it will tend to do that to avoid overfitting.'

However, there are methods to deal with observed confounding, such as double/debiased machine learning model. This involves:
1. Train model to predict feature (Ad spend) using set of confounders (features not caused by Ad spend)
2. Train model to predict outcome (Did Renew) using that set of confounders
3. Train model to predict residual variation of outcome (the variation left after subtracting our prediction) using the residual variation of the causal feature of interest

'The intuition is that if Ad Spend causes renewal, then the part of Ad Spend that can’t be predicted by other confounding features should be correlated with the part of renewal that can’t be predicted by other confounding features.' There are packages like econML's LinearDML for this.

**When can they not be used? (2) When you have non-confounding redundancy.** 'This occurs when the feature we want causal effects for causally drives, or is driven by, another feature included in the model, but that other feature is not a confounder of our feature of interest.'

Example: Sales Calls directly impact retention, but also have an indirect effect on retention through Interactions. We can see this in the SHAP scatter plots above, which show how XGBoost underestimates the true causal effect of Sales Calls because most of that effect got put onto the Interactions feature.

'Non-confounding redundancy can be fixed in principle by removing the redundant variables from the model (see below). For example, if we removed Interactions from the model then we will capture the full effect of making a sales call on renewal probability. This removal is also important for double ML, since double ML will fail to capture indirect causal effects if you control for downstream features caused by the feature of interest. In this case double ML will only measure the “direct” effect that does not pass through the other feature. Double ML is however robust to controlling for upstream non-confounding redundancy (where the redundant feature causes the feature of interest), though this will reduce your statistical power to detect true effects. Unfortunately, we often don’t know the true causal graph so it can be hard to know when another feature is redundant with our feature of interest because of observed confounding vs. non-confounding redundancy. If it is because of confounding then we should control for that feature using a method like double ML, whereas if it is a downstream consequence then we should drop the feature from our model if we want full causal effects rather than only direct effects. Controlling for a feature we shouldn’t tends to hide or split up causal effects, while failing to control for a feature we should have controlled for tends to infer causal effects that do not exist. This generally makes controlling for a feature the safer option when you are uncertain.'

**When can they not be used? (3) When you have unobserved confounding.** 'The Discount and Bugs Reported features both suffer from unobserved confounding because not all important variables (e.g., Product Need and Bugs Faced) are measured in the data. Even though both features are relatively independent of all the other features in the model, there are important drivers that are unmeasured. In this case, both predictive models and causal models that require confounders to be observed, like double ML, will fail. This is why double ML estimates a large negative causal effect for the Discount feature even when controlling for all other observed features'

'Specialized causal tools based on the principals of instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, or regression discontinuities can sometimes exploit partial randomization even in cases where a full experiment is impossible. For example, instrumental variable techniques can be used to identify causal effects in cases where we cannot randomly assign a treatment, but we can randomly nudge some customers towards treatment, like sending an email encouraging them to explore a new product feature. Difference-in-difference approaches can be helpful when the introduction of new treatments is staggered across groups. Finally, regression discontinuity approaches are a good option when patterns of treatment exhibit sharp cut-offs (for example qualification for treatment based on a specific, measurable trait like revenue over $5,000 per month).'

## NOT suitable: Including all possible confounders

'Many analysts take the strategy of putting in **all possible confounders**. This can be bad news, because adjusting for **colliders and mediators can introduce bias**, as we’ll discuss shortly. Instead, we’ll look at **minimally sufficient adjustment sets**: sets of covariates that, when adjusted for, block all back-door paths, but include no more or no less than necessary. That means there can be many minimally sufficient sets, and if you remove even one variable from a given set, a back-door path will open.'[[source]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/vignettes/intro-to-dags.html)

## Randomisation

Randomise to receive treatment - removes common cause of treatment and outcome.

This is best method.

Although even in randomised trial, we can't randomise whether people adhere to their assigned treatment.

Randomisation makes groups exchangeable. **Exchangeability** is when there are no confounders, so whatever treatment group each person was randomised too, we still would've seen the same outcomes in whichever were treated v.s. not, the groups are exchangeable. You can also express exchangeability in the language of counterfactuals.
* In the RCT, 11% die in treatment group and 1% die in treatment group
* So in each group, the average counterfactual outcome under treatment is 0.11 and under no treatment is 0.01 - so, the distribution of the counterfactual outcomes (Y under treatment and Y under no treatment) is the same in the treated and untreated group - so the counterfactual outcomes are independent of the actual treatment

## Methods to block back door paths

**Stratification** - e.g. restrict analysis to subset of study population with particular value of confounder - or do analysis in each stratum of confounder, and then pool the effect estimates - and most sophisticated way of doing is regression analysis. This is represented by drawing box on DAG.

**Matching** - e.g. matching each person with treatment and confounder, with someone with treatment and not confounder, and with someone who did not have treatment or confounder. Analysis is restricted to matched people. As the treatment and no treatment groups are matched on confounder, if there is association, then not due to confounder, as adjusted for it. This can't be represented in DAG, because non-faithfulness - the association to a backdoor path is exactly cancelled by the matched subset.

Sometimes construct **propensity score** (which is a function of the confounders) and then do stratification or matching based on the propensity score (rather than the confounders themselves).

G-METHOD: **Inverse probability weighting** - estimate probability of receiving treatment level actually received (and these probabilities witll be different depending on whether had confounder) - then compute inverse probability (1/probability) - then compute association between treatment and outcome, but each person is counted as many times as their inverse probability weight indicates.

* Person with heart disease treated with aspirin. Had a 50% chance of actually being treated with aspirin. Inverse probability weight 1/0.5 = 2.

Inverse probability weighting eliminates the backdoor through L.

G-METHOD: **Standardisation** - mathematically equivalent to inverse probability weighting - sometimes known as the **G-formula**

G-METHOD: **G-estimation**

What do all of these methods have in common?
* They require data on the confounders that block the backdoor path. If those data are available, then the choice of one of these methods over the others is often a matter of personal taste. Unless the treatment is time-varying -- then we have to go to G-methods. But if the data on the confounders are not available, then the method will not eliminate all the bias, and the magnitude of the residual bias will depend on how much of the backdoor path remains open.
* They require knowledge about the true causal DAG. If we don't know the true casual DAG, then we don't know the backdoor paths that we need to block.

## Methods that are alternatives to blocking backdoor paths

e.g. instrumental variable estimation

These methods are popular in economics, but often not general enough to adjust for confounding in many other settings (e.g. when treatment of interest changes over time) (as in time-varying treatments below).

## Others

Check if these are already covered or fit above:

Randomization to exposure, use of an instrumental variable, weighted regression via propensity scores, adjustment using multivariable regression, stratification on a confounder, conditioning enrollment on a confounder (restriction), and matching on a confounder.[[Lederer et al. 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201808-564PS)

static-cWith expert knowledge on the underlying causal structure we can account for confounding in the study design (e.g. through restriction, matching, Mendelian randomization or instrumental variable 2 analysis) or in the data analysis.[6-8] The most used methods in causal inference are multivariable regression techniques, in which we can calculate the exposure effect conditional on the presence of confounding factors, though more complex analytic methods such as propensity score matching or inverse probability weighting are also employed.[2] Though generally not advisable, data-driven confounder selection may be employed in small datasets, under the condition that the data has been pre-processed to entail that covariates fed into the statistical selection method are only potential confounders and free of mediators.[[source]](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10654-021-00794-w/MediaObjects/10654_2021_794_MOESM1_ESM.pdf)
