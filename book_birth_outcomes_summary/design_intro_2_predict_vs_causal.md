# Choosing between prediction and causal inference

`````{admonition} Executive summary
:class: info

Predictive research aims to predict an outcome with the **best accuracy**. Explainability (e.g. SHAP) is about understanding why a model makes certain predictions. When making predictions, whether the direction of relationships (e.g. from SHAP values) is true/causal doesn't matter, as the goal is just to make the best predictions.

Etiological research aims to **uncover causal effects**. It involves finding an unbiased estimate of the effect of X on Y, by controlling for confounding factors that could bias the estimate. In causal inference, the true direction of relationships (and the counterfactual scenarios) are important. It typically starts with drawing a causal diagram.

## How do you know whether you are interested in prediction or causation?

Scientific research can be categorised into descriptive, predictive and etiological research. Descriptive research aims to summarise the characteristics of a group (or person).[[Hamaker et al. 2020]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2020.100867) However, this page focusses just on **predictive and etiological research**.

| Aim | Aims to predict an outcome with the **best accuracy**.[[Ramspek et al. 2021]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00794-w) | Aims to uncover **causal effects** - i.e. **causal inference**. |
| Relationships | It doesn't matter whether predictors are causal or not - **just focussed on best prediction**. | Concerned with the **true causal relationships** between variables. |

### Illustrative example

A team have built an XGBoost model to predict whether customers will renew their subscription. They use SHAP values to understand how the model made its predictions. They notice a suprising finding: **users who report more bugs are more likely to renew. Is this a problem? It depends on their goal**

* If their goal is to **predict customer retention to estimate future revenue**, then this relationship is helpful for **prediction**, and it doesn't matter about the direction, as long as our predictions are good.

* However, if their goal is to **inform actions to help retain customers**, then it is important to understand the true relationships between features and the outcomes, and the counterfactual scenarios if features were modified. In this case, the team are interested in **causation**. In order for the team to understand the causal relationships, they would need to use causal inference methods (causal diagrams, appropriate techniques to account for confounding).

**Why did this finding occur?** If the team are interested in causation, they could draw a causal diagram (simplified version below). In it, they notice that some features are influenced by unmeasured confounding. WIth the example above, **users who report more bugs are people who use the product more so encounter more bugs, but need the product more so are more likely to report**. Because they canâ€™t directly measure product need, the correlation they end up capturing in the predict model between bugs reported and renewal combines a small negative direct effect of bugs faced and a large positive confounding effect from product need.

### Explainability v.s. causality

Explainability refers to being able to **understand why a model makes certain predictions**. The aim of explainable AI is to make ML models more transparent. It provides insights on:
* How a model makes predictions
* What features are most important
* How sensitive a model is to changes in the input [[Prosperi et al. 2020]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-020-0197-y)

The contribution of individual covariates are often mistakenly interpreted causally, but the methods used were focused on combining covariates to optimise predictive accuracy, and not to predict the outcome distribution under hypothetical interventions. [[Lin et al. 2021]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41512-021-00092-9)

However, it cannot be used to infer causal relationships, since the findings may be biased by stratification or unmeasured confounders, or mediated by other factors in the causal pathway.[[Prosperi et al. 2020]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-020-0197-y) If you wish to make claims about causality, you will need to build a casual model. Causal ML aims to **infer causal relationships** from observational data by estimating the effect of a specific variable on the outcome, while **appropriately controlling** for other confounding factors that could bias the estimate.[[source]](https://medium.com/@dahnert.sebastian/understand-the-difference-and-intersection-between-causal-ml-and-explainable-ai-65583132e704)

## Doing predictive AND etiological research

Many problems will require a **combination of prediction and causation**.
* "Pure forecasting task" - e.g. just want to predict whether or not it will rain, and don't care why/what caused the rain
* "Pure causation task" - e.g. performing a rain dance presumed to save dying crops, only if it actually causes rain
* Combination of the two - e.g. if planning assignment of fire inspectors across a city, should (a) predict will establishment will be in violation of fire codes, and (b) estimate causal effect on establishment's behaviour of receiving an inspection or not

Beck et al. 2018 also argue that **prediction remains relevant even if you're only interested in understanding causal effects**. Explanations that invoke causal mechanisms always make predictions - specifically, predictions about what will happen under an intervention. 'Whether they do so explicitly or not, that is, causal claims necessarily make predictions; thus it is both fair and arguably useful to hold them accountable for the accuracy of the predictions they make.' They therefore argue that the **predictive performance of models and of explanations** is important to include (e.g. R<sup>2</sup>, MAE, RMSE, AUC, accuracy, recall, F1).[[Beck et al. 2018]](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/u6vz5)

## Confusion and controversy

### Reasons for confusion

Causal inference can be confusing and controversial. Reasons for this are:
* Causally **unrelated** variables can be **highly correlated**
* Results may be reported in a way that is careful to avoid referring to any causal relationships, but it will often still **naturally be read and interpreted as causal**
* Even if there is a causal relationship, sometimes the **direction is unclear** - would need to carefully examine the temporal relationships between the variables[[source]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality/lecture/x4UMR/confusion-over-causality)

### Confusion in the literature

In practice, prediction and causation are **commonly conflated**. A review of observational studies found that 26% (46 / 180) observational cohort studies conflated between etiology and prediction -
* In causal studies, this was mainly due to selection of covariates based on their ability to predict **without taking causal structure into account**.
* In prediction studies, this was mainly due to **causal interpretation** of covariates included in a prediction model.

## Concepts and principles

### Ladder of causality

Judea Pearl proposed the '**Ladder of Causality**' to categorise different levels of causal thinking, with increasing levels of difficulty.

| Level | Typical activity | Typical questions | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Association** | Seeing | What is?<br>How would seeing X change my belief in Y? | What does a symptom tell me about a disease?<br>What does a survey tell us about the election results? |
| **Intervention** | Doing | What if?<br>What if I do X? | What if I take aspirin, will my headachbe be cured?<br>What if we ban cigarettes? |
| **Counterfactuals** | Imagining, retrospection | Why?<br>Was it X that caused Y?<br> What if I had acted differently? | Was it aspirin that stopped my headache?<br>Would Kennedy be alive had Oswald not shot him?<br>What if I had not been smoking the past two years? |

Difference between interventions and counterfactuals in this hierarchy:
* With interventions, you ask what will happen on average if you perform an action.
* With counterfactuals, you ask what would have happened if you had performed a different action.
* These two queries are mathematically distinct as they require different levels of information to be answered (counterfactuals need more information to be answered)'.[[source]](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/379799/difference-between-rungs-two-and-three-in-the-ladder-of-causation)

### Types of inference

From C.S.Peirce in late 1800s:
* '**Deduction** - necessary inference following logic' [[Zhao 2022]](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/teaching/causal-2023/notes-2021.pdf)
  * e.g. If dentist appointment at 10 and it's 30 minute drive, deduce you need to leave at 9.30 [[source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/deduction-vs-induction-vs-abduction)
* '**Induction** - probable or non-necessary inference (purely) based on statistical data
  * e.g. Correlation between cigarette smoking and lung cancer' [[Zhao 2022]](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/teaching/causal-2023/notes-2021.pdf)
  * Four of your six coworker order the same sandwich so you induce that the sandwich is probably good [[source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/deduction-vs-induction-vs-abduction)
* '**Abduction** - inference with implicit or explicit appeal to explanatory considerations
  * e.g. Investigation of a crime scene
  * Cigarette smoking causes lung cancer' [[Zhao 2022]](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/teaching/causal-2023/notes-2021.pdf)
