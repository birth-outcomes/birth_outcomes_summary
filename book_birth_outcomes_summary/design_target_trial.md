## What is target trial emulation?

'Routinely collected health care data from claims databases, registries, and electronic health records are increasingly used to answer causal questions on the benefits and harms of medical treatments. Observational studies that are of sufficiently high quality can supplement findings from randomized trials... Unfortunately, many observational studies use flawed designs and analyses that introduce avoidable biases, such as immortal time bias. Although many practitioners worry about confounding in observational studies, the effect of these “self-inflicted” biases is often much more severe.'

'Target trial emulation is a framework for designing and analyzing observational studies that aim to estimate the causal effect of interventions. For each causal question on an intervention, one can imagine the randomized trial (the “target trial”) that could have been conducted to answer that question. This target trial should be explicitly specified in a target trial protocol, which is similar to a trial protocol and includes the following components: eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, treatment assignment, start and end of follow-up, outcomes, causal contrast, and statistical analysis plan... After specifying the target trial protocol, the goal of the investigator is to set up a well-designed observational study that properly emulates each component of the protocol.'

'Target trial emulation does not solve the problem of confounding in observational studies; this requires measuring and appropriately adjusting for all confounders.' [[Fu 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.0000000000000152)

## Why is it needed?

'Many published observational studies use flawed study designs that do not properly align treatment assignment and follow-up at time zero and thus do not emulate the design of a randomized trial. These designs introduce avoidable biases on top of confounding, such as immortal time bias, lead time bias, or selection bias. A recent review found that 57% of included observational studies suffered from immortal time bias and 44% from depletion of susceptibles/prevalent user selection bias.'
