#  Apgar scores

Evaluates 'neonates immediately after birth and in response to resucitation'. They were 'originally designed to assess need for intervention to establish breathing at 1 minute', and not as an outcome measure.[[source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470569/)

## How they are calculated

 Record score at 1 minute (**Apgar-1**) and 5 minutes (**Apgar-5**). Score of 0-2 for five elements:
* **A**ppearance (pale/blue, pink with blue extremeties, pink - note: most will score 1 for color as peripheral cyanosis (blue discoloration of extremeties) is common among normal infants, and also colour can be misleading in non-white infants)
* **P**ulse (heart rate 0, <100bpm, or >100pm)
* **G**rimace (no response to stimulation, grimace to stimulation, cry/cough/sneeze to stimulation)
* **A**ctivity (loose/floppy muscle tone, some tone, flexed muscle tone)
* **R**espiration (not breathing, slow/weak breathing, vigorous crying)[[source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470569/)

## Interpretation

* Apgar score alone is not 'evidence of asphyxia or proof of intrapartum hypoxia'
* Low Apgar-1 'is not predictive of adverse clinical outcomes or long-term health issues' as most infants will have normal scores by 5 minutes
* **Apgar-5 < 7** is non-reassuring, and low scores 'correlate with mortality' and 'increased risk of cerebral palsy' - most infants will 'not go on to develop cerebral palsy, but lower scores over time increase risk'[[source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470569/)

## Suitability as a model outcome

Pros:
* Routinely collected

Cons:
* Subjective

## Conclusion

`````{admonition} Potentially suitable
:class: warning

Apgar-1 is not useful, but Apgar-5 could be - particularly in combination with other indicators of adverse outcomes. The big benefit of Apgar-5 is that it should be relatively complete, and provides a spectrum of outcomes. However, that is also it's downside - not specific to HIE.
