#  Apgar scores

Apgar scores are the most routinely used measure of the health status of newborns.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l1656) They evaluate 'neonates immediately after birth and in response to resucitation'. They were 'originally designed to assess need for intervention to establish breathing at 1 minute', and not as an outcome measure.[[source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470569/)

## How they are calculated

The Apgar score is typically quantified at 1 minute (**Apgar-1**), 5 minutes (**Apgar-5**) and 10 minutes(**Apgar-10**) after birth.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l1656)
 
Score of 0-2 for five elements:

| Element | Options |
| --- | --- |
| **A**ppearance | <ul><li>Pale/blue</li><li>Pink with blue extremeties</li><li>Pink</li></ul> |
| **P**ulse | <ul><li>Heart rate 0</li><li><100bpm</li><li>>100pm</li></ul> |
| **G**rimace | <ul><li>No response to stimulation</li><li>Grimace to stimulation</li><li>Cry/cough/sneeze to stimulation</li></ul> |
| **A**ctivity | <ul><li>Loose/floppy muscle tone</li><li>Some tone</li><li>Flexed muscle tone</li></ul> |
| **R**espiration | <ul><li>Not breathing</li><li>Slow/weak breathing</li><li>Vigorous crying</li></ul> | 

Note: Most will score 1 for color as peripheral cyanosis (blue discoloration of extremeties) is common among normal infants, and also colour can be misleading in non-white infants).

## Interpretation and association with neonatal outcomes

Interpretation:
* Normal: 7-10
* Needs monitoring for 5 minutes: 4-6
* Needs immediate attention: <3

Apgar score alone is not 'evidence of asphyxia or proof of intrapartum hypoxia'.

**Low Apgar-1** 'is not predictive of adverse clinical outcomes or long-term health issues' as most infants will have normal scores by 5 minutes

**Low Apgar-5** is non-reassuring, and low scores 'correlate with mortality' and 'increased risk of cerebral palsy' - most infants will 'not go on to develop cerebral palsy, but lower scores over time increase risk'.[[source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470569/)

## Suitability as a model outcome

Pros:
* Routinely collected
* Performed for a long time (first devised in 1952, and has since become a very common and routine measure)[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.04.012)

Cons:
* Subjective - most of the items require subjective judgements - most objective is the heart rate which is based on measured FHR[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.04.012)
* Score is calculated without weighting, assuming all variables contribute equally, which is untenable - e.g. importance of heartrate v.s. colour[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.04.012)
* Poor inter-rater reliablity - study of 223 health professionals found 68% agreement among pediatricians/pediatric house staff, and 24% agreement among nurses from community hospitals[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.04.012)
* Apgar-1 is not predictive of outcomes - Apgar-5 does associated with risk of adverse long-term outcomes - but many infants will be fine.

## Conclusion

`````{admonition} Unsuitable
:class: error

There are serious issues with the validity and reliability of Apgar scores.

The only points in its favour would be familiarity and routine collection, and that it is associated with higher risk of poor outcomes.
