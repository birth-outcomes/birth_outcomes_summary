# MRI showing basal ganglia damage

As on the **page about HIE**, MRIs can be used to help detect/diagnose HIE. There are different patterns of damage, with **basal ganglia damage** being associated with more severe asphyxia and with outcomes like cerebral palsy. To avoid repetition of information, please refer to that page for more details.

Example of MRI from full-term infant with MRI pattern suggestive of acute near total asphyxia:

## Suitability as a model outcome

Pros:
* Infants with suspected HIE who are observed to have this pattern in their MRI are definitely the cohort of infants who we are interested in

Cons:
* We likely can't get this data
