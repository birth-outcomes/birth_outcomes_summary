# Study design

## Broad aims

Using live labour data to predict who is likely to require caessarean, and reduce adverse effects for mother and baby. Combining data from fetus, parent, and CTG. Involves combining (a) risk factors during pregnancy, with (b) live risk factors during labour. Outcome of "X chance" of adverse outcome if don't go for caessarean or assisted delivery. Decision currently based on experience. Want some more objective evidence that can given women to help them understand and base risks on.

Can’t use outcomes in classical way because of treatment paradox. May need to reformulate, as this is not a prediction question. In women in labour, is there a way we can predict whose going to need something that allows us to act more effectively. Dave Right statistician screening for down syndrome example – all previous ranked top five predicting down syndrome and so on – doesn’t necessarily tell you best way, as those five together may predict less well than one of those and others, its more complex than that. You’re trying to produce an instrument that allows you to behave differently. 

spend 3 billion on care and 7.8 billion on claims.
* vast majority of delivers by caessarean or forceps are fine
* acting too late has risk of poor outcomes and of cerbral palsy
* most common legal composition is acute total collapse - babies heart rate suddenly drops from high, and if goes on for 10-15 min, baby usually has CP is survive, and basal ganglia damage

if definition of problem is avoiding fetal injury, is what is needed a more subtle instrument, or havgin experts who know what they’re doing. 


## Treatment paradox

Treatment paradox means you can’t use outcomes (eg baby died, bad apgar) because worse things are is more quickly you intervene. Classical example of when to do caessarean – longer wait outcome not worse, as when really bad you do quickly, and when not so bad you wait, so you end up with same level all along.

pyrexia in mother uncommon but can be bad outcome linked, but babies often born with normal blood gases, as infection is problem rather than acidosis. Majority of women with fever have fever due to epidural but those babies are fine, just hot. In cambridge data, epidural comes out as protective, but because thought to be pyrexia risk but was actually epidural.

## Design ideas

Judee Pearl, causal inference, would say you cannot tell these things from the data alone. Statisticians are used to only answer from data alone, other things non data, but humans are good at recognising patterns that data isn’t. E.g. a first thing cant be caused by second. But statistics can’t handle. He says you take models through experts of describing what are potential causal routes through here and model them under different conditions. If you expert is right about this causing this, then can predict effect size of this causing this. Gives you a way around this problem – not just relying on data. In stroke, want to be able say causally about link between thrombolysis and outcomes.

excluded delivery by caessarean in cambridge
* still subject to influence due to forcep delivery and so on – but potentially less issue
*  takes out highest risk groups

doing a trial

When the clinician thinks the baby is in trouble, what tells you whether it really is or isn’t – that narrows it down to a smaller group where intervention produces less of paradox.
* majoriy of sections for fetal distress are not true distress – its abnormal ctg but no fetal compromise
* correct – define of group not to be worried about

No treatment would be no low outcomes. We have better outcomes as experts intervene. The question is not is the child fine. The question is whether they would’ve been fine if hadn’t intervened, and we don’t know that. Looking for marginal improvement, thing has to be better than expert, and that’s a big ask

another way around paradox is how in stroke, say different units do different things, and helps them understand, as propensity to give ceassarean differs between hospitals, and that may allows us to dig into it
* issue will be is that it will be between clinician rather than site
* will still be site difference in rates even when account for socioeconomic and stuff, so there must be something
