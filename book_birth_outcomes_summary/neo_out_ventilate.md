# Mechanical ventilation

**Mechnical ventilation** is used for neonates with respiratory failure.  It aims to oxygenate the baby and to remove carbon dioxide. It carries risk of injury to the lungs, brain and other systems.[[source]](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/neonatal-respiratory-distress-syndrome/)

## How is this linked to HIE?

Respiratory management of asphyxiated infants is challenging because both the hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult and hypothermia have an impact on respiratory functions
* Perinatal hypoxia is often associated with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance or meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). In addition, HI injury is typically followed by cerebral reperfusion and excessive oxidative stress
* Hypothermia causes a decrease in metabolic rate with a parallel reduction in oxygen (O2) consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) production [[source]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41372-019-0349-2)

'Frequently observed symptoms in asphyxiated newborns, such as delayed initiation of spontaneous breathing, respiratory depression, pulmonary hypertension, and seizures often necessitate mechanical ventilation (in >60% of asphyxiated term newborns)'. Newborns with more severe asphyxia are more likely to need mechnical ventilation.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fchildren8060430)

## What other reasons are there for ventilation?

There are many reasons for ventilation, but something that commonly comes up is'newborn respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). This is 'when a baby's lungs are not fully developed and cannot provide enough oxygen, causing breathing difficulties. It usually affects premature babies.' 'Around half of all babies born between 28 and 32 weeks of pregnancy develop NRDS. In recent years the number of premature babies born with NRDS has been reduced with the use of steroid injections, which can be given to mothers during premature labour.' Regarding treatment after birth, this may just be extra oxygen for mild symptoms via an incubator (small mask over nose/face or tubes into nose), but if symptoms are more severe, this can be mechnical ventilation which supports or takes over their breathing.[[source]](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/neonatal-respiratory-distress-syndrome/)

## Suitability as a model outcome

Pros:
* Anecdotally Harriet found there wasn't much variation between true sites, implying it's a true marker of a sick baby rather than something that varies alot with clinician practice.

Pro/Con:
* The pathologies of infants requiring mechnical ventilation are broad

Cons:
* Not all infants with HIE will require mechnical ventilation - but hopefully would include more severe cases, as infants with more severe asphyxia are more likely to require it
