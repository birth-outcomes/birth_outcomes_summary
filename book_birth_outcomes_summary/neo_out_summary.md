# Summary of possible indicators

`````{admonition} Executive summary
:class: info

**Option 1:** Indicators where someone else decided HIE occurred

* Therapeutic hypothermia
* Diagnostic codes for HIE

**Option 2:** Combination of indicators for hypoxia and encephalopathy (some combination of which would've been used by the person who decided HIE occurred above).

* Indicators that hypoxia occurred:
    * Indicators of hypoxia - resuscitation, umbilical cord blood gas analysis, Apgar
    * Presence of sentinal events that can cause hypoxia
* Alongside indicators for brain injury:
    * Transfer to neonatal care services
    * Neuroimaging evidence consistent with HIE
    * Cerebral palsy diagnosis

**Not recommended**
* Death
* Abnormal CTG
* Meconium-stained amniotic fluid

## Context

For this research project, we need to identify a **preventable adverse neonatal outcomes** - i.e. outcome impacted by obstetrician decisions during delivery. Two examples are hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) or chorioamnionitis - and for now, we have focused on HIE.

In designing this research study, we want to explore possible outcomes that could be used to indicate that an infant has experienced HIE. The term 'outcome' is used fairly loosly to refer any indicators, including:
* Scores and measurements
* Observations
* Interventions
* Diagnoses

As on the prior page, attempts to diagnose/define/identify HIE are varied, with several different indicators used. I have explored these indicators (and others that have been mentioned or used elsewhere) in the following pages, and made concluding recommendations for each of the outcomes, which I have copied below. This should be read **in the context of the recommendations** on the previous page, such as those from the Neonatal Data Analysis Unit and the Task Force. The method of identifying HIE could involve a single indicator or combintions (AND / OR) of indicators.

## Recommendations

`````{admonition} Recommended as stand-alone indicators
:class: seealso

* **Therapeutic hypothermia:** Alone, this outcome is specific to HIE and should capture moderate to severe HIE cases. Requires consideration of whether certain units would be more likely to treat certain infants (either over time, or who don't meet the accepted criteria). Do be aware though that use of this as an outcome means that your definition of HIE is that criteria used to decide whether infants require cooling.

`````{admonition} Potentially recommended as combination indicators
:class: warning

* **Transfer to neonatal care services** - Alone, this is not suitable as 95%+ of admitted infants will not have HIE. However, in combination with other indicators of HIE, it could support identifying more unwell infants with HIE (most unwell, if focussed on NICU).
* **Resuscitation** - Potentially recommended. Resuscitation (e.g. mechanical ventilation, CPR, adrenaline) is often required in infants with HIE and infants who receive therapeutic hypothermia. However, not all infants need it, and not all infants who need it will have HIE, so should not use alone as an indicator. You might focus on a particular type of resuscitation - e.g. mechanical ventilation. Intubation may also be used as part of resuscitation (but no longer an indicator for meconium at delivery, as newborns are no longer intubated for this)
* **Umbilical cord blood gas analysis** - Potentially recommended. Must (a) consider metabolic acidosis, (b) not require low pH (as many infants with HIE won't have low pH), and (c) not base decision only on low pH (as many infants with low pH won't have HIE)
* **Diagnostic codes for HIE** - Potentially recommended. A French validation suggested half of infants coded with HIE were false positive, and that over a third of infants with HIE were not identified. Uncertain for English data, or for codes beyond ICD P91.6.
* **Cerebral palsy diagnosis** - Potentially recommended.  Spastic or dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy is an important outcome in the context of HIE. However, not all HIE cases will lead to cerebral palsy, and HIE is not the only possible cause of cerebral palsy.
* **Neuroimaging evidence consistent with HIE** - Potentially recommended. Not certain whether this data would be available, and whether it would be in a format we could interpret (i.e. without knowledge of MRI, just notes with conclusions of professional). Would definitely indicate brain injury occurred. Not certain whether it distinguishes cause of injury (i.e. HIE different patterns to NE of other causes) - but there are patterns typical of HIE infants, so it does help support the case for HIE in that sense.
`````

`````{admonition} Not recommended
:class: error

 * **Death** - Not recommended. Death is an outcome that can result from HIE - however, it doesn't help us identify whether or not an infant had HIE.
`````

To resort:
* **Abnormal CTG**
* **Apgar**
* **Meconium-stained amniotic fluid**
