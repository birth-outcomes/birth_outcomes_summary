# Summary

For this research project, we need to identify a **preventable adverse neonatal outcomes** - i.e. outcome impacted by obstetrician decisions during delivery. Two examples are hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) or chorioamnionitis - and for now, we have focused on HIE.

In designing this research study, we want to explore possible outcomes that could be used to indicate that an infant has experienced HIE. The term 'outcome' is used fairly loosly to refer any indicators, including:
* Scores and measurements
* Observations
* Interventions
* Diagnoses

Current suggestions below - but subject to change as we continue learn and understand and read more:

`````{admonition} Suitable
:class: seealso

* Admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
* Cooling/moderate hypothermia
* Mechanical ventilation
`````

`````{admonition} Potentially suitable
:class: warning

* Umbilical cord pH and base deficit (combined with other indicators, with some caveats to account for)
* Neonatal resuscitation
* Cerebral palsy diagnosis
`````

`````{admonition} Unsuitable
:class: error

* Abnormal CTG
* Apgar
* NNAP record of encephalopathy
* Meconium-stained amniotic fluid
* Transfer to any neonatal care services
* Intubation
* MRI showing basal ganglia damage
* Death
