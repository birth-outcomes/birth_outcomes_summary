# Summary

## Context

For this research project, we need to identify a **preventable adverse neonatal outcomes** - i.e. outcome impacted by obstetrician decisions during delivery. Two examples are hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) or chorioamnionitis - and for now, we have focused on HIE.

In designing this research study, we want to explore possible outcomes that could be used to indicate that an infant has experienced HIE. The term 'outcome' is used fairly loosly to refer any indicators, including:
* Scores and measurements
* Observations
* Interventions
* Diagnoses

As on the prior page, attempts to diagnose/define/identify HIE are varied, with several different indicators used. I have explored these indicators (and others that have been mentioned or used elsewhere) in the following pages, and made concluding recommendations for each of the outcomes, which I have copied below. This should be read **in the context of the recommendations** on the previous page, such as those from the Neonatal Data Analysis Unit and the Task Force. The method of identifying HIE could involve a single indicator or combintions (AND / OR) of indicators.

## Recommendations

`````{admonition} Recommended as stand-alone indicators
:class: seealso

* **Therapeutic hypothermia:** Alone, this outcome is specific to HIE and should capture moderate to severe HIE cases. Requires consideration of whether certain units would be more likely to treat certain infants (either over time, or who don't meet the accepted criteria).
`````

`````{admonition} Potentially recommended as combination indicators
:class: warning

* **Diagnostic codes for HIE** - Potentially recommended. A French validation suggested half of infants coded with HIE were false positive, and that over a third of infants with HIE were not identified. Uncertain for English data, or for codes beyond ICD P91.6, but their findings make me cautious.
* **Transfer to neonatal care services** - Alone, this is not suitable as 95%+ of admitted infants will not have HIE. However, in combination with other indicators of HIE, it could support identifying more unwell infants with HIE (most unwell, if focussed on NICU).
* **Resuscitation** - Potentially recommended. Resuscitation (e.g. mechanical ventilation, CPR, adrenaline) is often required in infants with HIE and infants who receive therapeutic hypothermia. However, not all infants need it, and not all infants who need it will have HIE, so should not use alone as an indicator. You might focus on a particular type of resuscitation - e.g. mechanical ventilation. Intubation may also be used as part of resuscitation (but no longer an indicator for meconium at delivery, as newborns are no longer intubated for this)
* **Umbilical cord blood gas analysis** - Potentially recommended. Must (a) consider metabolic acidosis, (b) not require low pH (as many infants with HIE won't have low pH), and (c) not base decision only on low pH (as many infants with low pH won't have HIE)
`````

`````{admonition} Not recommended
:class: error

 * **Death** - Not recommended. Death is an outcome that can result from HIE - however, it doesn't help us identify whether or not an infant had HIE.
`````

To resort:
* **Cerebral palsy diagnosis**
* **Abnormal CTG**
* **Apgar**
* **Meconium-stained amniotic fluid**
* **Intubation**
* **Neuroimaging evidence consistent with HIE**
