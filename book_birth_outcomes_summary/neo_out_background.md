# Current practice for identifying hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)

`````{admonition} Executive summary
:class: info

**Neonatal encephalopthy (NE)**:
* NE refers to neurological dysfunction in late pre-term or term infants, characterised by seizures, impaired consciousness, respiratory difficulties and reduced tone.
* Causes include hypoxia-ischemia, stroke, infection, intracranial hemorrhage, congenital anomalies, neurometabolic and genetic factors. NE can have a single or multiple causes.
* Approximately 1 to 6 per 1000 term births have NE. In more than half, the cause is unknown. The most common cause is hypoxia ischaemia (referred to as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy).

**Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)**: Our challenge is that there has not been a clear, consistent consensus definition for HIE and NE. The terms have often been used interchangeably (despite HIE actually being a sub-type of NE). Recent recommendations for defining (and thereby identifying/diagnosing/distinguishing HIE) are:
* Neonatal Data Analysis Unit:
    * **Diagnostic code for NE or HIE Diagnosis of NE or HIE (severe, moderate, grade 2 or grade 3)**
    * **OR Therapeutic hypothermia for 2 or more consecutive days**
* ACOG-AAP task force:
    * **Presence of sentinel hypoxic or ischaemic event**
    * **Presence of fetal acidosis and low Apgar**
    * **Evidence of multiple organ dysfunction**
    * **Neuroimaging evidence**
* DEFiNE group - research ongoing to establish consensus definition for NE

The current recommendation is to first diagnose NE, and only diagnose HIE on the basis of sufficient evidence.

A task force hoping to define when you can establish a causal relationship with cerebral palsy required:
* **Metabolic acidosis** in blood gas analysis
* **Early onset** of NE
* **Spastic quadriplegia or dyskinetic type of cerebral palsy**
* **Exclusion of other etiologies** like trauma, coagulation disorders, infectious conditions, or genetic disorders

## Neonatal encephalopathy (NE)

### Broad definition of NE

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) refers to brain disease, damage or malfunction, as a result of perinatal brain injury. The broad clinical definition of NE is that it is:
* A neurological syndrome
* In infants born at or beyond 35 weeks of gestation (late pre-term or term)
* Characterised by:
  * Seizures
  * Impaired levels of consciousness
  * Difficulties initiating and maintaining respiration
  * Reduced tone and reflexes[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

### Causes of NE

Possible causes of NE include:
* **Hypoxia ischaemia** (most common cause, "hypoxia" means low levels of oxygen in blood flowing to tissues, and "ischaemia" means blood flow (and therefore oxygen) is restricted/reduced to tissues) (this has sometimes been referred to as asphyxia, perinatal asphyxia, or birth asphyxia - but these terminology are not recommended) (when this is the case, it is referred to as **hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy**)
* **Perinatal/neonatal stroke** (ischemic perinatal stroke (IPS) is the leading known cause of hemiplegic CP [[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpeds.2022.100025))
* **Infection** (chorioamnionitis)
* **Intracranial haemorrhage** (bleed in the skull/brain)
* **Congenital brain anomalies/malformations** (brain 'abnormalities present at birth that can result from developmental disruptions at various embryonic or fetal stages'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spen.2022.100973))
* **Neurometabolic** (extensive and diverse set of neurometabolic disorders that can impact the neonatal prain, presentation is non-specific and can mimic acquired things like HIE and sepsis. They are rare, and are primarily genetic disorders leading to disruption of enzyme activity, cellular transport, or energy production [[source]](https://journals.lww.com/topicsinmri/fulltext/2018/08000/neurometabolic_disorders_of_the_newborn.1.aspx))
* **Genetic and epigenetics factors**[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)[[Source - NHS East of England Guidelines for Management of Infants with Suspected HIE]](https://www.eoeneonatalpccsicnetwork.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HIE-Guideline.pdf)

NE **does not have to have a single cause** - for example, you could distinguish between hypoxia-ischaemia alone, a combination of other etiologies with hypoxia ischaemia, or non-HI-related etiology.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) 'Sentinel events such as cord prolapse, uterine rupture, or abruptio placentae may be clearly associated with HIE but often HIE is a **secondary** event. Therefore although hypoxia-ischemia may be involved

**Focusing on HIE...**

The exact cause of HIE is often not identified. Causes include cord prolapse, uterine rupture, abruptio placenta, placenta previa, maternal hypotension, breech presentation, should dystonia[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004)

There have been several medical malpractice claims related to HIE. This list of causes from [Michigan Cerbral Palsy Attornerys](https://www.michigancerebralpalsyattorneys.com/causes-and-risk-factors-of-cerebral-palsy/labor-and-delivery-problems/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie-infographic/) includes some examples that relate to that.
* Birth trauma - delayed emergency C-section, prolonged and arrested labour, post-term pregnancy, anaesthesia mistakes, intracrainal haemmhorage, fetal monitoring errors
* Abnormal size and presentation - cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), breech presentation, face presentation, macrosomia
* Labour and delivery problems - miuse of pitocin or cytotec, uterine rupture, placental abruption, umbilical cord problems (prolapse, compression, nuchal and short), placenta previa, uteroplacental insufficiency, premature rupture of membranes
* Maternal health problems - pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios
* Infant health problems - fetal stroke, mismanagement of fetal respiration after delivery, mismanaged of fetal anemia after delivery

Note: Haven't checked all these - but for example of fetal stroke, from a quick google, it appears that HIE and neonatal stroke can often occur together, and that it seems more that the asphyxia is then a risk factor for stroke.

### Signs of HIE

Signs and symptoms of HIE before birth include: 'decreased fetal movement, severe maternal cramping (often accompanied by severe back pain), abnormal fetal heart rate, abnormal contraction pattern, vaginal bleeding, abnormally low or high maternal weight gain, maternal high blood pressure'.

Signs and symptoms of HIE shortly after birth (in neonates) include: 'low Apgar scores at five or 10 minutes, seizures, difficulty feeding, breathing problems, hypotonia (low muscle tone), organ problems (failure, damage), acidemia (low pH in umbilical cord blood gas tests), abnormal response to light, state of abnormal consciousness (hyperalert or lethargic), coma'

'**In some children with HIE, especially those with mild to moderate HIE, obvious signs and symptoms of an oxygen-depriving event may not be present at the time of birth**... HIE may beconme more evident later in infancy.' Signs and symptoms of HIE during infancy and early childhood include: 'impaired motor function, delayed developmental milestones, seizure disorder, delayed growth, hearing and visual impairments'.

### Incidence

Below are some incidence estimates from a few difference sources.

NE:
* 1.15 million infants per annum.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)
* Affects 2 to 6 per 1000 term births.[[Russ et al. 2021]](https://doi.org/10.1542/neo.22-3-e148), or in 1-3 per 1000 term births[[Hagberg et al. 2016]](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.nbd.2015.09.011)

Unknown cause:
* In more than half of cases of encephalopathy, the cause is **unidentified**.[[Molloy et al. 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)

Hypoxia ischaemia as cause of NE:
* Hypoxia ischaemia contributes to approximately 29% of neonatal encephalopathy.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)
* Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy accounts for 1.5 per 1000 term births.[[Russ et al. 2021]](https://doi.org/10.1542/neo.22-3-e148)
* Hypoxia ischaemia is known to be 'the sole instigator of encephalopathy in an estimated 7% of infants with NE. The Vermont Oxford Network Neonatal Encephalopathy Registry found that an asphyxia event accounted for 15% and inflammation 24% of cases of NE with other maternal etiologies also implicated'.[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)
* 'Some authors state that HIE is the cause of NE in 50%–80% of cases based on clinical, EEG, and MRI criteria.'[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)
* 'The incidence of HIE has not declined even with advances in obstetric care (i.e. fetal monitoring) aimed at preventing the hypoxic-ischemic event.'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004) Rapid recognition of and response to hypoxic ischaemia is extremely challenging for obstetricians.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1576/toag.13.3.169.27669)
* The greatest burden of NE is in **low-middle-income** countries.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

This section is in no way comprehensive - these are just a couple of random statistics from various sources in varying cohorts - on outcomes of infants with HIE:
* 'Around 20%–50% of infants with HIE die early in infancy, and 25%–60% of surviving infants have long-term neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and learning disabilities'.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.3345/cep.2020.01459)
* In a study of mild HIE, 4.1% (17/414) infants had the composite outcome, whilst 0.9% (4786/504661) without HIE had it. Infants with mild HIE are four times as likely to be diagnosed with the composite outcome (HR 4.42, 95% CI 2.75–7.12) compared with infants without HIE (outcome was composite of cerebral palsy, epilepsy, intellectual disability and death up to 6 years of age)[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.17533)
* By the age of 2, 40 to 60% of infants with HIE will either die or have severe disabilities.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004) These include:
    * **Intellectual disability**
    * **Epilepsy**
    * **Cerebral palsy (CP)**

## Diagnosing HIE

### Challenge 1: Identifying cause

Diagnosis of HIE or asphyxia is often over-utilised in practice and not clinically justified by the limited data at birth.[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

**Identifying the precise causal pathway is often challenging**. 'Careful clinical phenotyping may help differentiation of NE by cause. This requires examination of the obstetric course and fetal monitoring records; careful and repeated neurological examination; early multichannel EEG or aEEG recordings of background brain activity; MRI and ultrasound brain imaging; and microbiological, biochemical and genetic analysis to rule out sepsis, inborn errors of metabolism, or epileptic encephalopathies, where indicated'.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

For HIE, it is also **difficult to quantify the dose, duration and severity** of hypoxia ischaemia. However, it is also important that a consensus definition is reached for mild HE, which has been variably defined. This is particular as the risk/benefit of providing therapeutic hypothermia to mild NE is not yet well characterised and trials are required.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

### Challenge 2: Terminology

The definition for neonatal encephalopathy (as presented on the last page) does not **does not specify subgroups, etiology, or guide management**. This ambiguity has been criticised as hindering case definition, collaborative research, and data synthesis and confusing families and caregivers.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

Moreover, the terms "neonatal encephalopathy" and "hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy" have often been **used interchangeably**, which is misleading, as HIE is actually a sub-group of NE. In practice, NE can occassionally be mistaked for HIE at birth. Also, congential neuromuscular disorders can be mistaken for NE (if they are disorders that involve abnormal tone,movements, and respiratory insufficiency).[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

A systematic review of 67 RCTs from 1998 to 2022 found notable variation in terminology - 56/67 referred to HIE, whilst 16 referred to NE - and yet the most common inclusion criteria were not necessarily specific to HIE - Apgar scores, metabolic acidosis, reduced level of consciousness, reduced tone, and abnormal reflexes.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

### Importance

It is beneficial to understand the aetiology of NE. It can lead to the development of targeted adjunctive therapies related to the underlying mechanism and development of preventative strategies.[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9) 'NE could be stratified by etiology. Subclassification and consensus definition will allow better collaboration and development of appropriate therapies for each subgroup, as a single “magic bullet” therapy is unlikely to treat all potential causes of NE.'[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

It is also important when we might do harm by attributing a cause (e.g. hypoxia ischemia) to the disorder (encephalopathy).[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

Clear diagnosis is crucial for parents to help them to access accurate prognostic information and support.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

An early diagnosis is also crucial - as, for example, treatment with therapeutic hypothermia must be within the first six hours of injury for optimum benefit.[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y)

## Recommendations and precedent for diagnosing/identifying HIE

### Neonatal Data Analysis Unit and the Department of Health

The Department of Health commissioned the Neonatal Data Analysis Unit (NDAU) at Imperial College London to extract data from the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) and to calculate annual rates for Brain injuries occurring during or soon after birth for England from 2010 to 2015. As part of this work, they had to develop a definition and methodology for identifying brain injury. The working definition is copied below (as well as on the prior page about definitions of NE & HIE).

This group definied **brain injuries occurring during or soon after birth** as followed:
* Population - all babies admitted to a neonatal unit
* Time period after birth - all brain injuries detected during neonatal unit stay
* Conditions included -
    - **Signs** consistent with **neonatal encephalopathy** in term or near term infants (**altered tone, altered consciousness, seizures**)
    - **Diagnosis** of intracranial haemorrhage, perinatal stroke, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE), central nervous system infection, or kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) in any infants
    - Preterm white matter disease (periventricular leukomalacia) in pre-term infants
* Denominator - all live births
* Exclusions - congenital encephalopathies (including inborn errors of metabolism), congenital infections, and congenital brain abnormalities

However, they found that data on signs of NE were not consistent over time - the fields used to define "altered tone" and "altered consciousness" only began from October 2010 onwards. Therefore, for this project, they dropped those and just looked for "seizures".

**Focus on HIE definition...**

In the briefing paper circulated before their meeting, they note that the current definition used by Each Baby Counts (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists national quality improvement programme) is:
* Greater than or equal to 37 weeks gestation at birth
* Any of the following diagnosis codes entered into Diagnosis at discharge field:
    * Severe Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE)
    * Severe Neonatal Encephalopathy
    * Grade 3 Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE)
* OR meet one of the following criteria from daily variables, within first 7 days:
    * Decreased central tone and comatose and seizures
    * Received therapeutic hypothermia (cooling)
    * Receiving diagnosis (daily data variable) of severe (grade 3) Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE)

They note that defining HIE by treatment means:
* It will include infants who do not develop detectable brain injury
* It may discourage use of treatment in borderline cases

In the briefing paper, they offer some options of definitions to be considered, for HIE these were:
* Daily variables observed within first 72 hours, and therapeutic hypothermia needs to be received for 3 consecutive days

The decision decided upon in their consensus meeting for HIE was:
* **Diagnosis of NE or HIE (severe, moderate, grade 2 or grade 3)**
* **Therapeutic hypothermia for 2 or more consecutive days**

[[Gale et al. 2017]](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a82446ced915d74e6236ad3/Report_on_brain_injury_occurring_during_or_soon_after_birth.pdf)


### Definition of HIE from the American Colleges of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Pediatrics (ACOG-AAP) Task Force

The American Colleges of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Pediatrics (ACOG-AAP) task force defined HIE as a **restrospectively designated diagnosis - i.e. you start with a diagnosis of NE** and then subsequency - based on accumulated evidence - subclassify it as HIE. Their recommend that a diagnosis includes:

1. The presence of a **sentinel hypoxic or ischemic event** occurring immediately before, during or after birth - e.g. a rupture uterus, severe abruption placentae, or fetal heart rate monitor patterns consistent with an acute peripartum or intrapartum event

2. The presence of **fetal acidosis** ((pH < 7.0 or base deficit ≥12 mmol/L)) and **low Apgar** scores (Apgar score <5 at 5 and 10 min)

3. Evidence of **multiple organ dysfunction** affecting the heart, liver, or kidneys

4. **Neuroimaging evidence** of acute brain injury with MRI or magnetic resonance spectroscopy, (a) consistent with hypoxia ischaemia and excluding other causes, and (b) consistent with acute peripartum or intrapartum event (i.e. timing)[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9) [[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

This definition may exclude some cases of HIE due to factors like:
* Milder acidosis
* Higher Apgar scores
* Non-classical patterns of injury on MRI
* Progressive, subacute evolution of HIE
* Incomplete data, such as outcomes that do not include severe motor deficit
* Incomplete data collection[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)

### Establishing causal relationship with cerebral palsy from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy

In order to establish a **causal relationship** between an acute intrapartum interruption of placental blood flow and later cerebral palsy, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force on Neonatal Encephalopathy and Cerebral Palsy require:

1. Evidence of **metabolic acidosis** in fetal umbilical cord arterial blood obtained at delivery

2. **Early onset of NE**

3. **Spastic quadriplegia or dyskinetic** type of cerebral palsy

4. **Exclusion** of other identifiable etiologies such as trauma, coagulation disorders, infectious conditions, or genetic disorders[[Chalak et al. 2019]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0547-9)

### Initial diagnosis of NE and then HIE

'It is difficult to prove the presence of cerebral hypoxic ischemia with the exception of well characterized animal models and particular cases of neonatal stroke.'
[[Molloy and Bearer 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0169-7)

'As such, many prominent bodies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM), advocate for using NE until the exact aetiology is determined.'[[COHESION - Quirke et al. 2013]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02938-y) This means that using descriptive terminology like NE is preferable in the newborn period, before workup and course are known, rather than an etiology-based definition like HIE, which implies a single known etiology.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) Clinical categorization, such as NE caused by sepsis, genetic causes, stroke, or those with a multifocal origin is required to ensure targeted management where possible for non-HIE causes.[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z) 

### The DEFiNE group

'An international evidence-based consensus is required to define NE, classify the subgroups, and their diagnostic criteria.' **The DEFiNE group has 'developed a protocol for a consensus definition of NE.** The evidence synthesis has started with a systematic review of definitions of NE used in randomized controlled trials involving patients with NE. This has revealed a huge disparity between, and little consensus on, definitions of NE. The next stage is to complete a protocol for a study to develop an international and multidisciplinary consensus definition using a modified Delphi consensus approach. The Delphi approach is an iterative process with repeated rounds of evaluation and voting to help determine consensus among a group of experts and parents with different levels of knowledge and expertise. We will use an online real-time Delphi approach to arrive at a consensus definition.'[[DEFiNE - Molloy et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-023-02775-z)
