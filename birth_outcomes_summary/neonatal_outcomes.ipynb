    "### Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)** is a type of brain injury that occurs because a hypoxic-ischaemic event prevents adequate blood flow to the infant's brain during prenatal, intrapartum or the postnatal period. 'It occurs in 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births in developed countries'. 'The incidence of HIE has not declined even with advances in obstetric care (i.e. fetal monitoring) aimed at preventing the hypoxic-ischemic event.'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004) Rapid recognition of and response to hypoxic ischaemia is extremely challenging for obstetricians.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1576/toag.13.3.169.27669)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the age of 2, 40 to 60% of infants with HIE will either **die or have severe disabilities**.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004) These include:\n",
    "* **Intellectual disability**\n",
    "* **Epilepsy**\n",
    "* **Cerebral palsy (CP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Causes of HIE\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact cause of HIE is often not identified. Causes include:\n",
    "* Cord prolapse\n",
    "* Uterine rupture\n",
    "* Abruptio placenta\n",
    "* Placenta previa\n",
    "* Maternal hypotension\n",
    "* Breech presentation\n",
    "* Should dystonia[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004)\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been several medical malpractice claims related to HIE. This list of causes from [Michigan Cerbral Palsy Attornerys](https://www.michigancerebralpalsyattorneys.com/causes-and-risk-factors-of-cerebral-palsy/labor-and-delivery-problems/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie-infographic/) includes some examples that relate to that.\n",
    "* **Birth trauma** - delayed emergency C-section, prolonged and arrested labour, post-term pregnancy, anaesthesia mistakes, intracrainal haemmhorage, fetal monitoring errors\n",
    "* **Abnormal size and presentation** - cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), breech presentation, face presentation, macrosomia\n",
    "* **Labour and delivery problems** - miuse of pitocin or cytotec, uterine rupture, placental abruption, umbilical cord problems (prolapse, compression, nuchal and short), placenta previa, uteroplacental insufficiency, premature rupture of membranes\n",
    "* **Maternal health problems** - pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios\n",
    "* **Infant health problems** - fetal stroke, mismanagement of fetal respiration after delivery, mismanaged of fetal anemia after delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Haven't checked all these - but for example of fetal stroke, from a quick google, it appears that HIE and neonatal stroke can often occur together, and that it seems more that the asphyxia is then a risk factor for stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neontal tests for HIE\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of methods can be used to diagnose HIE, including the APGAR score, brain imaging, umbilical cord blood gas tests, and developmental evaluations.[[source]](https://hiehelpcenter.org/medical/identifying-hie/tests-evaluations-screening/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging technique used 'during the first week after birth to determine the extent of brain injury and predict neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with symptoms of HIE'. 'The two main patterns of injury can be distinguished with MRI in the full-term neonate':\n",
    "* **Basal ganglia-thalamus pattern (BGT)**.\n",
    "    * More severe hypoxia ischamia\n",
    "    * 'When the baby suffers severe or total hypoxia/asphyxia, the insult is called' **acute near total or acute profound asphyxia**.\n",
    "    * 'With very severe insults, there will usually be a central pattern of focal neuronal injury (deep gray matter injury) to many levels of the central nervous system, with diffuse and pronounced neuronal necrosis (death of brain cells). When the insult is relatively abrupt and severe, there will be an injury to the deep nuclear brain structures, such as the basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem.'\n",
    "    * 'Children with the BGT pattern of injury tend to be severely disabled due to dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP).'\n",
    "* **Watershed predominant pattern of injury (WS)**\n",
    "    * Less severe hypoxia ischaemia\n",
    "    * This is the other pattern of injury, also referred to as **prolonged partial or partial prolonged asphyxia**\n",
    "    * This 'usually lasts for more than 30 minutes, mainleading leading to cortical injury in the watershed and parasagittal regions, with relative sparing of damage to the deep gray matter.'\n",

The WHO’s International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 and ICD-11 define chorioamnionitis as O41.12X “Chorioamnionitis” and as JA88.1 “Infection of the amniotic sac and membranes,” respectively. The United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for preterm labor does not mention “chorioamnionitis” but does describe prelabor rupture of membranes as risk factor for “intrauterine infection”. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defines chorioamnionitis as “an infection with resultant inflammation of any combination of the amniotic fluid, placenta, fetus, fetal membranes, or decidua”.'\n",

When the brain does not have enough oxygen or energy to function, it produces toxic chemicals which can ultimately damage a baby’s brain. When oxygen is restored to the brain, there is a time period where the brain attempts to recover from the injury. Unfortunately, a second wave of toxic chemicals is often released, which can further injure the brain. Because of this, the majority of brain damage can occur during and after restoration of blood flow and oxygen to the brain – not necessarily during birth. Once the cooling therapy is completed, we slowly warm the baby back up to inhibit the production of additional chemicals and reduce the risk of brain damage.'[[source]](https://utswmed.org/medblog/total-body-cooling-saving-babies-lives-after-emergency-delivery/)\n",
