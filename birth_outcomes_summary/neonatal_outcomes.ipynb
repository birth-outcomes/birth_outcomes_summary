    "### Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)** is a type of brain injury that occurs because a hypoxic-ischaemic event prevents adequate blood flow to the infant's brain during prenatal, intrapartum or the postnatal period. 'It occurs in 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births in developed countries'. 'The incidence of HIE has not declined even with advances in obstetric care (i.e. fetal monitoring) aimed at preventing the hypoxic-ischemic event.'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004) Rapid recognition of and response to hypoxic ischaemia is extremely challenging for obstetricians.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1576/toag.13.3.169.27669)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the age of 2, 40 to 60% of infants with HIE will either **die or have severe disabilities**.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004) These include:\n",
    "* **Intellectual disability**\n",
    "* **Epilepsy**\n",
    "* **Cerebral palsy (CP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Causes of HIE\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact cause of HIE is often not identified. Causes include:\n",
    "* Cord prolapse\n",
    "* Uterine rupture\n",
    "* Abruptio placenta\n",
    "* Placenta previa\n",
    "* Maternal hypotension\n",

    "* Should dystonia[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004)\n",

    "There have been several medical malpractice claims related to HIE. This list of causes from [Michigan Cerbral Palsy Attornerys](https://www.michigancerebralpalsyattorneys.com/causes-and-risk-factors-of-cerebral-palsy/labor-and-delivery-problems/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-hie-infographic/) includes some examples that relate to that.\n",
    "* **Birth trauma** - delayed emergency C-section, prolonged and arrested labour, post-term pregnancy, anaesthesia mistakes, intracrainal haemmhorage, fetal monitoring errors\n",
    "* **Abnormal size and presentation** - cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), breech presentation, face presentation, macrosomia\n",
    "* **Labour and delivery problems** - miuse of pitocin or cytotec, uterine rupture, placental abruption, umbilical cord problems (prolapse, compression, nuchal and short), placenta previa, uteroplacental insufficiency, premature rupture of membranes\n",
    "* **Maternal health problems** - pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios\n",
    "* **Infant health problems** - fetal stroke, mismanagement of fetal respiration after delivery, mismanaged of fetal anemia after delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Haven't checked all these - but for example of fetal stroke, from a quick google, it appears that HIE and neonatal stroke can often occur together, and that it seems more that the asphyxia is then a risk factor for stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neontal tests for HIE\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of methods can be used to diagnose HIE, including the APGAR score, brain imaging, umbilical cord blood gas tests, and developmental evaluations.[[source]](https://hiehelpcenter.org/medical/identifying-hie/tests-evaluations-screening/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging technique used 'during the first week after birth to determine the extent of brain injury and predict neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with symptoms of HIE'. 'The two main patterns of injury can be distinguished with MRI in the full-term neonate':\n",
    "* **Basal ganglia-thalamus pattern (BGT)**.\n",
    "    * More severe hypoxia ischamia\n",
    "    * 'When the baby suffers severe or total hypoxia/asphyxia, the insult is called' **acute near total or acute profound asphyxia**.\n",
    "    * 'With very severe insults, there will usually be a central pattern of focal neuronal injury (deep gray matter injury) to many levels of the central nervous system, with diffuse and pronounced neuronal necrosis (death of brain cells). When the insult is relatively abrupt and severe, there will be an injury to the deep nuclear brain structures, such as the basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem.'\n",
    "    * 'Children with the BGT pattern of injury tend to be severely disabled due to dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP).'\n",
    "* **Watershed predominant pattern of injury (WS)**\n",
    "    * Less severe hypoxia ischaemia\n",
    "    * This is the other pattern of injury, also referred to as **prolonged partial or partial prolonged asphyxia**\n",
    "    * This 'usually lasts for more than 30 minutes, mainleading leading to cortical injury in the watershed and parasagittal regions, with relative sparing of damage to the deep gray matter.'\n",

The WHO’s International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 and ICD-11 define chorioamnionitis as O41.12X “Chorioamnionitis” and as JA88.1 “Infection of the amniotic sac and membranes,” respectively. The United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for preterm labor does not mention “chorioamnionitis” but does describe prelabor rupture of membranes as risk factor for “intrauterine infection”. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defines chorioamnionitis as “an infection with resultant inflammation of any combination of the amniotic fluid, placenta, fetus, fetal membranes, or decidua”.'\n",

    "\n",
    "'Cardiotocography (CTG) was introduced in the 1960s to detect fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns thought to indicate hypoxia. However, its value has been an ongoing topic of debate. A Cochrane review of trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of the intrapartum CTG showed that although the use of CTG is associated with a reduction in neonatal seizures it does not prevent perinatal death or cerebral palsy. Furthermore, CTG monitoring has been associated with rising cesarean section rates which are independently associated with maternal risks.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'A key issue with the use of CTG is interpretation. Several reports have suggested CTG misinterpretation as the main contributory cause in preventable cases of HIE and perinatal deaths. There are different guidelines worldwide for CTG interpretation. There is not only substantial inter-observer disagreement using individual guidelines but also poor agreement when the comparison is made across different guidelines. Furthermore, some experts argue that looking at CTG based on pattern recognition alone with emphasis on FHR decelerations results in unnecessary interventions for non-acidotic babies who mount normal responses to hypoxia and has no correlation with neonatal outcomes.'\n",

    "'During labor the fetus is intermittently deprived of O<sub>2</sub>, with a fall of 5% to 10% in oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) below baseline when the intrauterine pressure exceeds approximately 30 mm Hg during myometrial contractions. At 35 mm Hg of intrauterine pressure, which is the level at which we can usually feel the contractions on the abdominal wall, the uteroplacental blood flow disappears at the end of diastole, and at 60 mm Hg diastolic flow ceases completely. The occurrence of FHR decelerations accompanied by transient shunting of blood from peripheral to central organs during such O<sub>2</sub> deprivation is a normal physiological fetal response, known as the “diving reflex” in aquatic mammals and birds. The diving reflex thus strives to preserve an aerobic metabolism in central organs, provided by the concomitant metabolic down-regulation in peripheral organs. In a fetus already suffering a baseline O<sub>2</sub> deficit when at rest, such as with placental insufficiency in fetal growth restriction (FGR), the superimposed hypoxic stress by uterine contractions may progressively cause severe hypoxia, acidosis, and severe FHR decelerations. A loss of umbilical artery end-diastolic flow may then appear during both variable and late FHR decelerations. The umbilical artery flow resistance increases concomitantly which further compromises the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion across the placental membranes. The lowest SaO<sub>2</sub> is reached at the end of a contraction, and it takes up to 2 minutes after the peak of contraction to recover to baseline. Thus, when >5 labor contractions per 10 minutes occur, a full recovery might not be reached between contractions, and a superimposed fetal hypoxemia (low blood oxygen) develops. An intact fetus resists the strain of normal labor, but with tachysystole (>5 contractions every 10 minutes) a critical limit might be reached, which then also affects a previously healthy fetus.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2022.07.001)\n",

Eighty percent of these newborns with clinical indicators of acidemia with a low pH develop seizures in the first few days after birth.

This is 'when a baby's lungs are not fully developed and cannot provide enough oxygen, causing breathing difficulties. It usually affects premature babies.' 'Around half of all babies born between 28 and 32 weeks of pregnancy develop NRDS. In recent years the number of premature babies born with NRDS has been reduced with the use of steroid injections, which can be given to mothers during premature labour.' Regarding treatment after birth, this may just be extra oxygen for mild symptoms via an incubator (small mask over nose/face or tubes into nose), but if symptoms are more severe, this can be mechnical ventilation which supports or takes over their breathing.[[source]](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/neonatal-respiratory-distress-syndrome/)\n",
