    "'**Perinatal brain injury** is common in **term infants**' (births between 37 and 42 completed weeks) in all countries. 'Almost all forms of perinatal brain injury will result into **neonatal encephalopathy**' (brain disease, damage or malfunction). 'Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1-3 per 1000 infants born at term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common cause of encephalopathy is **hypoxia ischaemia**. *Hypoxia is when there are low levels of oxygen in the blood flowing to the tissues. Ischaemia is when blood flow (and therefore oxygen) is restricted/reduced to tissues.* Somtimes this is referred to as **asphyxia or birth asphyxia**.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Encephalopathy can also result from **perinatal/neonatal stroke**.'\n",

    "\n",
    "**Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)** is a type of brain injury that occurs because a hypoxic-ischaemic event prevents adequate blood flow to the infant's brain during prenatal, intrapartum or the postnatal period. 'It occurs in 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births in developed countries'. 'The incidence of HIE has not declined even with advances in obstetric care (i.e. fetal monitoring) aimed at preventing the hypoxic-ischemic event.'[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1053%2Fj.nainr.2011.07.004) Rapid recognition of and response to hypoxic ischaemia is extremely challenging for obstetricians.[[source]](https://doi.org/10.1576/toag.13.3.169.27669)\n",
    "\n",

    "    * 'When the baby suffers severe or total hypoxia/asphyxia, the insult is called' **acute near total or acute profound asphyxia**.\n",
    "    * 'With very severe insults, there will usually be a central pattern of focal neuronal injury (deep gray matter injury) to many levels of the central nervous system, with diffuse and pronounced neuronal necrosis (death of brain cells). When the insult is relatively abrupt and severe, there will be an injury to the deep nuclear brain structures, such as the basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem.'\n",
    "    * 'Children with the BGT pattern of injury tend to be severely disabled due to dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP).'\n",
    "* **Watershed predominant pattern of injury (WS)**\n",
    "    * Less severe hypoxia ischaemia\n",
    "    * This is the other pattern of injury, also referred to as **prolonged partial or partial prolonged asphyia**\n",
