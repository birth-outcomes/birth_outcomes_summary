# NNAP record of encephalopathy

The National Neonatal Audit Programme includes a measure of encephalopathy in babies born at 35 weeks gestational age or above, within the first three full calendar days after birth.

Encephalopathy is categorised if the baby was admitted to neonatal care for at least 72 hours and the daily summaries from those 72 hours include two or more of the following neurological signs in the same daily data summary:
* **Abnormal tone**
* **Lethargic or comatose consciousness**
* **Convulsions**

These details were captured on BadgerNet in daily summary forms (forms are created for each baby for each calendar day where they are an inpatient on a neonatal unit).

In the 2019 NNAP report on data from 2018, there was 0.01% missing data.

## Suitability as a model outcome

Pros:
* As this is for auditing, does this incentivise more data completion?

Cons:
* It does not appear to be in the latest NNAP Audit Measures [[source]](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2024-01/2024_nnap_audit_measures_guide_v1.0_0.pdf)
* Level of missing data is low, but is that because it assumes incompletion of tone and consciousness and convulsions means no encephalopathy, when actually it could be failure to complete record?
* This is not a specific type of encephalopathy
* This is not the typical criteria for diagnosis of HIE?

:class: error

As we're not planning to use this data, and as I think it's been remove from the NNAP audit.
