# Proposal

Standardisation of treatment
Yes - although not true in practice, as decision to intervene (caesarean) and timing of that intervention varies between clinicians and hospitals - could deal with statistically 

Predictor substitution 
No

Treatment as a predictor
Yes - although limitation is significan

Treatment as an outcome
Yes - although, if I'm correct in understanding that there are many reasons why an emergency caesarean might be performed, this may not be specific enough? And that often, caesareans are performed and they think actually they shouldn't have been, and vice versa? 

Propensity scores
Yes - although being aware of that limitation

Exclusion of treated individuals
Yes - although a bit limited
