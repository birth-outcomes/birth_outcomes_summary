# HIE proposal 4: vaginal only

Another example.

## Introduction

As in [research proposal 1](./research_proposal.md).

## Aims and objectives

Comparing the maternal, pregnancy and labour characteristics in cases of vaginal births with HIE versus no NE.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria:
* Vaginal birth
* HIE or no NE
* Infants born at or beyond 35 weeks of gestation
* Singleton pregnancies

Exclusion criteria:
* Caesarean (elective or emergency)
* NE that is not caused by hypoxia ischaemia

## Outcome

The outcome is comparing infants with HIE to those with NE. Definition of HIE as in [research proposal 1](./research_proposal.md). To identify infants with no NE, would perhaps suggest a combination of:
* No diagnostic codes for NE
* No diagnostic codes for the symptoms of NE (seizures, impaired consciousness, difficulties with respiration, reduced tone) (this would require more discussion/thought)

## Research design

Compare the characteristics of HIE cases and no NE cases using descriptive statistics.

Using explainable ML model to predict whether it was HIE or NE - although this might be hampered by the major imbalance.

## Limitations

If we expect that there will be few HIE cases, and that clinicians would intervene in many of them, this would reduce our sample size.

We could assume that this sample would include cases where there were none of the typical indicators for HIE, so the prognostic ability of certain variables is minimised, as they have been removed from the sample. This creates selection bias. This is not a way that we "escape" the treatment paradox - instead, this is a way of doing an analysis that is true for these patients, but not necessarily generalisable to patients where they would receive emergency caesareans (?)
