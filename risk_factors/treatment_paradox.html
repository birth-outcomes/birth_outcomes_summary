<p>A <strong>treatment paradox</strong> is when a prognostic factor:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(A) Has a <strong>strong relationship</strong> with the outcome, and</p></li>
<li><p>(B) When its present, <strong>triggers an effective treatment</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>It will mean that the prognostic factor will appear to have <strong>poorer performance</strong> than it actually has, and hence leading to <strong>underestimation of outcomes</strong> for people with that prognostic factor. For example, may find an unexpected protective relationship between two factors that actually have a harmful relationship.</p>
<p>A treatment paradox is relevant to causal inference studies (as its about the true relationship between the treatment and the outcome, rather than using the presence of treatment to help best predict the outcome).</p>

<h2>What is a treatment paradox?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-treatment-paradox" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>treatment paradox</strong> (or “<strong>intervention effect</strong>”, or “<strong>treatment use</strong> in a validation study”) is ‘when a <strong>strong prognostic factor of an adverse outcome triggers an effective treatment</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, if we wanted to demonstrate the presence of a treatment paradox, we would need to meet two criteria:</p>

<li><p>The prognostic factor has a <strong>strong relationship with the outcome</strong></p></li>
<li><p>When the prognostic factor is present, it <strong>triggers an effective treatment</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1136%2Fbmjopen-2020-046518">[Uffen et al. 2021]</a></p></li>

<p><strong>Lack of generalisability</strong> - the aim of predictive models will often be to help guide decisions to treat on future patients (i.e. they have not yet received any treatments). <strong>Models trained on treated patients will offer poor/biased performance, underestimating risk, which can be attributed to treatment use in the validation data.</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12874-017-0375-8">[Pajouheshnia et al. 2017]</a></p>
<p>The impact of treatment use depends on various factors…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Strength of effect of treatment on outcome - e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If weak effect, then impact will be small<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12874-017-0375-8">[Pajouheshnia et al. 2017]</a></p></li>
<li><p>When a strong prognostic factors triggers an effective treatment, it reduces incidence of the outcome, and meaning that the prognostic factor that initiated the treatment will <strong>appear to have a poorer prognostic performance than it actually has.</strong> This can lead to an <strong>underestimation of adverse outcomes for people with that prognostic factor</strong>. <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1136%2Fbmjopen-2020-046518">[Uffen et al. 2021]</a> This leads to a lack of <strong>generalisability</strong>.<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.120812">[Schuit et al. 2013]</a></p></li>

<li><p>Whether treatment is allocated randomly or based on individual risk profile or based on strict treatment guidelines - e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If high-risk individuals are selectively treated, this will have a large impact - ‘<strong>distribution of observed risks will become narrower</strong>, due to the risk-lowering effects of treatment in the high-risk individuals,  making it <strong>more difficult for the model to discriminate</strong> between individuals who will or will not develop the outcome, and the calibration in high-risk individuals will be most greatly affected’<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12874-017-0375-8">[Pajouheshnia et al. 2017]</a></p></li>

<h3>Is this relevant to obstetrics?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-this-relevant-to-obstetrics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely! In fact, obstetric examples are quite commonly cited in papers about the treatment paradox, and there are a few papers focused on this, such as the paper by <a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.13860">Cheong-See et al. 2016</a> - ‘<strong>Prediction models in obstetrics: understanding the treatment paradox and potential solutions to the threat it poses</strong>’.</p>
<p>They describe clinicians use “probabilitic reasoning” to identify high risk pregnancies (based on clinical history and tests) - and how there is potential benefit for data-driven prediction/prognostic models providing individualised risk estimates are relevant in helping identify pregnancies at risk of adverse outcomes, to help guide clinical management and targeted interventions - as we are hoping to explore in this project.</p>
<p>They describe common statistical challenges - which are relevant to us also:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ascertainment of a suitable sample size - this is likely to be a problem, particularly if we choose a specific endpoint like HIE</p></li>
<li><p>The choice of candidate predictors</p></li>
<li><p>Reliable measurement of the outcome and predictors</p></li>
<li><p>The identification of important predictors and their functional form</p></li>
<li><p>Internal validation, potentially including bootstrap resampling and cross-validation, as well as shrinkage for potential over-optimism in model performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of external validation (many obstetric models perform well when internally validated but few have been externally validated using a population seperate from development) - <em>see end of page for a few extra notes on this</em></p></li>
<li><p>Lack of evaluation of the impact of models on clinician behaviour and patient outcomes</p></li>

<h2>Treatment paradox for caesarean and HIE<a class="headerlink" href="#treatment-paradox-for-caesarean-and-hie" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In our case, we have a treatment paradox as indicators of poor outcome (e.g. abnormal fetal heart rate (FHR), gestational age) will trigger an effective treatment (caesarean). Hence, if we fit a prediction model where those indicators were used to predict risk of HIE, the relationship between the indicators and outcome will be biased by the selection to receive treatment which helps prevent the outcome, e.g.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Protective relationship between abnormal FHR and HIE, even though abnormal FHR is an indicator that there is likely something wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Protective relationship between gestational age and HIE, even though we know later gestational age makes sentinal events that lead to hypoxia more likely, but masked by the fact that it also makes selection for caesarean section more likely</p></li>

<section id="standardisation-of-treatment">
<h3>Standardisation of treatment<a class="headerlink" href="#standardisation-of-treatment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This is a scenario where there is complete collinearity between the predictor and the treatment, where the presence of a particular predictor will <strong>always</strong> guarantee the presence of a particular treatment. In this case, the predictor is deterministic of treatment (i.e. everyone with this predictor <em>definitely</em> receives treatment - complete colinearity between predictor and treatment). This requires <strong>fully standardised care (same medication, same dose, same treatment thresholds)</strong>.</p>
<p>This is not realistic. Example: Management of early-onset pre-eclampsia, such as the commencement of anti-hypertensives and magnesium sulphate, this is somewhat standardised by guidelines [e.g. from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK], but the threshold for commencing treatment varies between clinicians and centres. Furthermore, the response from a specific antihypertensive and dosage varies between individual patients.</p>
<p>You can however use multi-level models to account for differences between clinicians and treatment centres.<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.13859">[Cheong-See et al. 2016]</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.13860">Steer 2016</a> comments though that ‘such models rarely take into account all of the relevant factors (e.g. the coexistence of a modulating pathology such as an autoimmune disorder) or the social and emotional circumstances and preferences of the mother and her family.’<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.13860">[Steer 2016]</a></p>

<h2>How does this relate to causal inference?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-this-relate-to-causal-inference" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Ultimately, our interest is in understanding the true relationships between variables, which is also the focus of causal inference studies.</p>
<p>However, it is important to be aware that in causal inference, you are focussed on understanding the causal effect of an exposure or treatment on an outcome, whilst controlling for confounders for that relationship. If you create a model that includes those confounders, the effect estimates between the confounders and the outcome are still at risk of being impacted by residual confounding or bias, as we did not go through the process for their relationship, and only for the primary relationship of interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, some of those methods fall under the banner of “causal inference”, and could be designed in such a way that you would be estimating the causal effect between an exposure and an outcome, but it does not mean that you are finding causal effects between all variables and the outcome (which is often the focus below - having a multivariable model that accounts for treatment use - that is still a prediction model).</p>
<p>If you were however to just focus on the relationship between the treatment and the outcome, then similarities would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Standardisation of treatment –&gt; Instrumental variable analysis - where the hospital/clinician (a) cause variation in treatment, (b) are unrelated to outcome - and so can be used as an instrumental variable</p></li>

<p><strong>Study sample</strong>: Pre-eclampsia is multisystemic, different predictor groups associated with different outcomes, ‘case mix impacts on the distribution of the predictors and the prevalence of the outcomes, and this in turn impacts on predictor–outcome associations, thereby influencing the accuracy of the model.’</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> More than one relevant outcome (e.g. eclampsia, abruption). As very few mothers will develop early-onset pre-eclampsia, these outcomes will occur at very low rates. This would not meet the suggested level of having 10-15 outcome events per predictor - and so, they recommend using composite outcomes and competing risk models.</p>

<li><p>‘Historically, the field of obstetrics has been successful in developing prediction models but has been poor in fully validating and thus implementing them effectively… Only two thirds of the papers [62.4%, 164/263] in a large systematic review of prognostic models in obstetrics were found to have presented their models in such a way that external validation would be feasible. This has been highlighted as a concern given the importance of validity in the development of such models.’<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.87311">[Murphy et al. 2019]</a></p></li>
<li><p>‘Certain models can be too complex for routine clinical usage and this may lead to a reluctance on the part of the clinicians to accept them… It is also important that models which have been developed are also validated in a new population as otherwise it may not be possible to generalise them to a different cohort of patients. This is also known as impact analysis and this paper by Reilly et al. highlights that very few prediction models have undergone formal impact analysis or validation. This is essential in order for clinicians to know if the usage of such a model will have a positive or negative effect, i.e. is there a possibility that it will cause harm. The authors highlighted the benefit of having clinicians involved in the development and validation of such models before, during and after implementation.’<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.87311">[Murphy et al. 2019]</a></p></li>
