# Study design

There are two sections.
* One is focussed on designing a study that allows us to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes during labour, whilst accounting for the effect of treatment use on relationships (which can otherwise bias the obtained results).
* The other is focussed on design of a study that would enable us to understand who best to intervene with and when.
