We are designing a research project focussed around the prevention of adverse outcomes during labour. This book was developed by Amy Heather to further our understanding around this topic and help guide design of the project.

::::{grid-item}
:::{admonition} Causal inference: introduction and core concepts

Introduces causal inference, differentiates it from prediction, goes over the theree "languages", and details about DAGs, estimands, assumptions and target trials.

:::{admonition} Causal inference: methods

Describes key methods for causal inference.

::::{grid-item}
:::{admonition} Outcomes
:class: important

Identifying which adverse outcomes to focus on, and how best to measure these - in particular, identifying cases of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.

::::{grid-item}
:::{admonition} Study design: risk factors
:class: danger

Designing a study to identify risk factors of an adverse outcomes, with designing accounting for the effect of treatment use on relationships. Includes examples of existing studies.

There is also an Appendices section, which contains some additional notes around various topics (some incomplete/older).
