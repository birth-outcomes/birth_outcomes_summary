# Other possible outcomes

## Why would we be interested in other outcomes?

**#1. Too few HIE cases.** HIE is a fairly rare outcome. Depending on the criteria used to identify cases, and depending on the size of our dataset, there is a possibility that we have too few cases of HIE for us to use it as an endpoint To contextualise this...
* The reported incidence of NE ranges from about 2 to 6 per 1000 live births, and the incidence of HIE ranges from about **1 to 8 per 1000** live births, although these figures have several limitations.[[Kurinczuk et a. 2010]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2010.05.010)
* [[Törn et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.17533) - using data from Swedish national health and quality registers from **2009 to 2015, 0.0008% had mild HIE diagnosis(n=414, whilst n=504661 had no HIE)**
* [[Leith et al. 2024]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2023.11.011) - using US dataset of **836,216 births, of which 376 (0.00045%) had a diagnosis of HIE**
* [[Odd et al. 2017]](https://doi.org/10.3233/NPM-16152) - using Bristol dataset of 14,000 births. In the training set, had **6712 births, of which 130 (0.01%) had HIE**

**#2. We might be interested in other outcomes anyway.** This book is quite focussed on HIE at present, but that is simply because of our meeting in January, which almost entirely revolved around HIE. However, it would be totally possible to have a less specific focus, and look at more general outcomes - and indeed, the protocol for the ethics application is broader that that, suggesting outcomes of:
* Perinatal death (antenatal and intrapartum)
* Resuscitation by intubation
* Five minute Apgar score <7
* 1, 5 and 10 minute Apgar scores
* Mode of delivery (spontaneous, vacuum, forceps, caesarean)
* Whether rotation needed
* Whether attempted vaginal delivery prior to CS
* Transfer to special care

## Which outcomes should we focus on?

I have not done alot of research into this. However, whilst looking into HIE, I have come across examples of papers looking more broadly at outcomes, and examples include:
* **Maternal and perinatal complications** - Maternal complication = maternal death, neurological, hepatic, cardiorespiratory, renal or haematological complications, or delivery before 34 weeks. Perinatal complications by discharge = perinatal or infant mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterecolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, retionpathy of prematury, or HIE. [[Thangaratinam et al. 2017]](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-017-0827-3)
* **Adverse pregnancy outcome** - Composite of: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, LGA, neonatal hypoglycaemia, shoulder dystocia, fetal death, neonatal death, bone fracture, nerve palsy. [[Cooray et al. 2020]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038845)
* **Adverse neonatal outcome** - 5-min Apgar <7, or composite of 5-minute Apgar score <7, resuscitation by intubation and/or perinatal death. [[Steer et al. 2023]](https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.17531)
* **Adverse pregnancy outcomes** - delivery by elective or emergency caesarean section,pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, small-for-gestational-age, stillbirth, neonatal death and neonatal unit admission for at least 48 hours. [[Syngelaki et al. 2022]](https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.26036)

## What are the consequences of this?

If looking at a broader outcome (and not with the intention of it being an indicator for HIE), this has implications for the predictors you should include, and any DAGs, and ultimately what your research question and focus is all about.
