This jupyter book summarises key concepts relating to birth outcomes, and delves deeper into two key topics:
1. **Outcomes** - what birth outcomes should we focus on, and what measures/indicators should we use to identify them?
2. **Study design in the context of a treatment paradox** - how can we use causal inference methods to help us design a study in the context of a treatment paradox?
