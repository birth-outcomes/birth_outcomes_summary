# Cardiotocograph (CTG) analysis

<mark> complete this page </mark>

How **cardiotocograph data** is analysed and incorporated as a predictor is also complex, with a wide range of methods used in the literature, as explored in https://github.com/birth-outcomes/ctg_exploratory and https://github.com/birth-outcomes/fhrma_python. For example:

> * Generating a set of parameters that describe the signal (clinically relevant or others), and the chosen method for that analysis
> * Transforming the signal, such as into an image using continuous wavelet transformation, and the chosen parameters
