	abstract = {Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of neurological sequelae in (near-)term newborns. Despite the use of therapeutic hypothermia, a significant number of newborns still experience impaired neurodevelopment. Neuroimaging is the standard of care in infants with HIE to determine the timing and nature of the injury, guide further treatment decisions, and predict neurodevelopmental outcomes. Cranial ultrasonography is a helpful noninvasive tool to assess the brain before initiation of hypothermia to look for abnormalities suggestive of HIE mimics or antenatal onset of injury. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which includes diffusion-weighted imaging has, however, become the gold standard to assess brain injury in infants with HIE, and has an excellent prognostic utility. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides complementary metabolic information and has also been shown to be a reliable prognostic biomarker. Advanced imaging modalities, including diffusion tensor imaging and arterial spin labeling, are increasingly being used to gain further information about the etiology and prognosis of brain injury. Over the past decades, tremendous progress has been made in the field of neonatal neuroimaging. In this review, the main brain injury patterns of infants with HIE, the application of conventional and advanced MRI techniques in these newborns, and HIE mimics, will be described.},

In the past, treatment options were limited to supportive medical therapy. Currently, several experimental treatments are being explored in neonates and animal models to ameliorate the effects of secondary energy failure. This review discusses the underlying pathophysiologic effects of a hypoxic-ischemic event and experimental treatment modalities being explored to manage infants with HIE.

Design Population-based cohort study. Setting Sweden, 2009–2015. Population Live term born infants without congenital malformations or chromosomal abnormalities (n = 505 075). Methods Birth and health data were retrieved from Swedish national health and quality registers. Mild HIE was identified by diagnosis in either the Swedish Medical Birth Register or the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Main outcome measures A composite of the outcomes cerebral palsy, epilepsy, mental retardation and death up to 6 years of age. Results Median follow-up time was 3.3 years after birth. Of 414 infants diagnosed with mild HIE, 17 were classified according to the composite outcome and incidence rates were 12.6 and 2.9 per 1000 child-years in infants with and without HIE respectively. Infants with mild HIE was four times as likely to be diagnosed with the composite outcome (HR 4.42, 95\% CI 2.75–7.12) compared with infants without HIE. When analysed separately, associations were found with cerebral palsy (HR 21.50, 95\% CI 9.59–48.19) and death (HR 19.10, 95\% CI 7.90–46.21). HRs remained essentially unchanged after adjustment for covariates. Conclusions Mild neonatal HIE was associated with neurological morbidity and mortality in childhood. Challenges include identifying infants who may develop morbidity and how to prevent adverse outcomes.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To build an evidence-based model to estimate case-specific risk of perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.
Methods
A retrospective, cross-sectional study of all births in Hawaii, Michigan, and New Jersey between 2010 and 2015, using linked maternal labor/delivery and neonatal birth records. Stepwise logistic regression and competitive Akaike information criterion were used to identify the most parsimonious model. Predictive ability of the model was measured with bootstrapped optimism-adjusted area under the ROC curve.
Results
Among 836,216 births there were 376 (0.45 per 1000) cases of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The final model included 28 variables, 24 associated with increased risk, and 4 that were protective. The optimism-adjusted area under the ROC curve was 0.84. Estimated risk in the study population ranged from 1 in ∼323,000 to 1 in 2.5. The final model confirmed known risk factors (e.g., sentinel events and shoulder dystocia) and identified novel risk factors, such as maternal race and insurance status.
Conclusion
Our study shows that risk of perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy injury can be estimated with high confidence. Our model fills a notable gap in the study of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy prevention: the estimation of risk, particularly in the United States population which is unique with respect to racial and socioeconomic disparities.},

We present a new metric: the “Fetal Reserve Index” (FRI), formally incorporating EFM with maternal, obstetrical, fetal risk factors, and excessive uterine activity for assessment of risk for cerebral palsy (CP). Methods: We performed a retrospective, case-control series of 50 term CP cases with apparent intrapartum neurological injury and 200 controls. All were deemed neurologically normal on admission. We compared the FRI against ACOG Category (I-III) system and long-term outcome parameters against ACOG monograph (NEACP) requirements for labor-induced fetal neurological injury. Results: Abnormal FRI's identified 100\% of CP cases and did so hours before injury. ACOG Category III identified only 44\% and much later. Retrospective ACOG monograph criteria were found in at most 30\% of intrapartum-acquired CP patients; only 27\% had umbilical or neonatal pH \&lt;7.0. Conclusions: In this initial, retrospective trial, an abnormal FRI identified all cases of labor-related neurological injury more reliably and earlier than Category III, which may allow fetal therapy by intrauterine resuscitation. The combination of traditional EFM with maternal, obstetrical, and fetal risk factors creating the FRI performed much better as a screening test than EFM alone. Our quantified screening system needs further evaluation in prospective trials.},

This paper provides a recipe for augmenting deep learning methods to accurately characterize such relationships in the presence of instrument variables (IVs) – sources of treatment randomization that are conditionally independent from the outcomes. Our IV specification resolves into two prediction tasks that can be solved with deep neural nets: a first-stage network for treatment prediction and a second-stage network whose loss function involves integration over the conditional treatment distribution. This Deep IV framework allows us to take advantage of off-the-shelf supervised learning techniques to estimate causal effects by adapting the loss function. Experiments show that it outperforms existing machine learning approaches.},

	abstract = {Objective The quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) is developed as a tool to identify patients with infection with increased risk of dying from sepsis in non-intensive care unit settings, like the emergency department (ED). An abnormal score may trigger the initiation of appropriate therapy to reduce that risk. This study assesses the risk of a treatment paradox: the effect of a strong predictor for mortality will be reduced if that predictor also acts as a trigger for initiating treatment to prevent mortality.
Design Retrospective analysis on data from a large observational cohort.
Setting ED of a tertiary medical centre in the Netherlands.
Participants 3178 consecutive patients with suspected infection.
Primary outcome To evaluate the existence of a treatment paradox by determining the influence of baseline qSOFA on treatment decisions within the first 24 hours after admission.
Results 226 (7.1\%) had a qSOFA ≥2, of which 51 (22.6\%) died within 30 days. Area under receiver operating characteristics of qSOFA for 30-day mortality was 0.68 (95\% CI 0.61 to 0.75). Patients with a qSOFA ≥2 had higher odds of receiving any form of intensive therapy (OR 11.4 (95\% CI 7.5 to 17.1)), such as aggressive fluid resuscitation (OR 8.8 95\% CI 6.6 to 11.8), fast antibiotic administration (OR 8.5, 95\% CI 5.7 to 12.3) or vasopressic therapy (OR 17.3, 95\% CI 11.2 to 26.8), compared with patients with qSOFA {\textless}2.
Conclusion In ED patients with suspected infection, a qSOFA ≥2 was associated with more intensive treatment. This could lead to inadequate prediction of 30-day mortality due to the presence of a treatment paradox.
